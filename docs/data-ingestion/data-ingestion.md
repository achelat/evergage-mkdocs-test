Ingestion of data into Interaction Studio from external data sources is provided by a built-in data-feed processing capability called **Feeds**. Feeds are a specific type of Interaction Studio [Gear](/gears) extension that provide the pathways used to send external data files and incorporate the data they contain into the Interaction Studio platform. The data files must be created, formatted and provided by companies according to Interaction Studio requirements, while the Feed pathways used to support the data files must be configured by Interaction Studio Gear developers. Feeds can be used to automatically or manually update the company catalog, import and export market segments, load historical data, and more. Once a Feed is configured, Interaction Studio business users can then use the **Feeds Dashboard** to view and manage Feed data file processing in the Interaction Studio platform.
