Data modeling in Interaction Studio involves the configuration of the platform to represent the key business information for your company. Data in Interaction Studio represents three primary areas of key information: user behaviors, tracked at the user, account, business, or household level; shadow catalog information, representing key business objects; and statistical tracking of key performance indicators, such as purchase revenue.

The configuration of these features is accomplished in the Interaction Studio platform by administrators during initial setup.
