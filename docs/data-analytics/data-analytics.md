Through its normal operations, Interaction Studio tracks and measures customer and prospect engagement across a companyâ€™s many channels at both the individual and business account levels. The data tracked by Interaction Studio includes digital interactions, active time spent, preferences, intent, purchases, referring source, browser, geolocation, survey responses, weather, and other indicators or measures of engagement and behavior. 
## Interaction Studio Data Warehouse
Interaction Studio provides support for data analytics on the data it tracks through our Data Warehouse. The data warehouse allows data scientists and business data analysts to use Business Intelligence (BI) tools to analyze and report on this valuable data without impacting the performance of Interaction Studio or the company web site. Leveraging data analytics capabilities on the Interaction Studio data warehouse, companies can better understand their customers, evaluate their campaigns, personalize content, create content strategies, develop better products, and more.
