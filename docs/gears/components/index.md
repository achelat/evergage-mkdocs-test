While a Gear could consist of stand alone TypeScript code, it is common for them integrate with the Interaction Studio Core system at one or more execution points. This is accomplished by extending one of the many Gear Component types provided. Components are differentiated from [System Services](/gears/system-services) in that Gears use system services to call into the Interaction Studio system while a component is called by the Interaction Studio system at a point determined by the component type.
