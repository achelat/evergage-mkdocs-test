Interaction Studio's Open-time Email (OTE) Campaigns and Item Templates enable you to deliver content and product recommendations personalized at the time a recipient opens an email. You can develop OTE campaigns and item templates with the Interaction Studio UI and generate HTML code to insert into an email campaign that you can send using your existing email marketing system. You only need basic HTML knowledge to build OTE campaigns and templates within the UI. However, you may require developer assistance to customize and extend the generated HTML.

This section contains links to articles and code samples that help you customize and work with the HTML code generated via Interaction Studio OTE campaigns and templates.
