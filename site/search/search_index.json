Interaction Studio\u2019s campaign & templates system is designed to be business user friendly while also empowering developers to determine what data and what level of flexibility a business user has access to. Interaction Studio campaigns can be broken down into four types: Interaction Studio Campaign Types \u00b6 Web Campaigns: To support web campaigns, developers are responsible for integrating Interaction Studio with the client\u2019s website(s) and for developing web templates that business users can leverage to build out campaigns including A/B/n and rules based tests. Documentation on integrating Interaction Studio with your website is available here and information on how to leverage campaign templates can be found here Server-Side Campaigns: Leveraging a similar approach as web campaigns, developers can configure templates specifically for server-side campaigns. A business user is still able to control test configuration and set-up, but will collaborate more closely with their development team to ensure that they are leveraging Interaction Studio\u2019s Event API correctly for their campaign execution. Additional information on building a Server-Side Campaign from a template can be found here. Email Campaigns: Developers may have limited or no involvement in open time email campaign development, depending on the capabilities of the business users in the company. Email campaigns are developed through the Interaction Studio UI, but require some basic knowledge of HTML, which may or may not require developer involvement. Additional documentation on how to configure Open Time email campaigns is available on Interaction Studio\u2019s knowledge base. Mobile Campaigns: Interaction Studio can support campaigns for display on mobile devices by using responsive HTML (HTML5) in its normal web templates feature or through integration with native iOS and Android mobile apps.

Getting Started \u00b6 Surveys is available to all Premium edition customers. If your account was provisioned prior to 4/7/2021, you will need to request a Gears refresh for your account from support in order for the Surveys Gear to show up in your Gears list and for the feature functionality to be fully enabled. If you are unsure if a Gears refresh has occurred, please reach out to your account admin who will be able to view the Gears list on your account. If a refresh occurred, they will see the Surveys Gear in the list as enabled. Create at least one survey in the Surveys editor, which can be found in the IS Dashboard. Once the above has been done, you will now be able to use the Surveys system in Templates. For more information on creating a survey, see Create or Edit a Survey . Third Party Library \u00b6 SurveyJS - version: 1.0.95 - sizes: JS(compressed) - 149 kB, CSS(compressed) - 4.0 kB This version of SurveyJS is a variant of the jQuery version updated to use the Cash library that is included in the Interaction Studio WebSDK. However, this means that there may be unsupported features, such as SurveyJS's custom widgets. API \u00b6 Methods \u00b6 renderSurvey(survey: Survey, renderTarget: Element): Promise<void> Injects the SurveyJS library, renders survey, and handles responses when completed. Survey should have the following shape: interface Survey { id: string, name: string, config: SurveyConfig // references SurveyJS's JSON object } injectSurveyResourcesIntoPage(): Promise<void> Use this if you want custom integration such as custom themes. Using the Surveys Gear \u00b6 Invoking renderSurvey will automatically use injectSurveyResourcesIntoPage to inject the SurveyJS library from the Interaction Studio CDN on pageload. Please note that this doesn't apply to client-side page changes, such as those in a SPA . Once the SurveyJS library instance is detected, it will start to render the survey. When each page of the survey is \"completed\" or \"submitted\", it will parse through survey config and send an event with each response stored as a survey attribute. Storing Responses on the User Profile \u00b6 Surveys attributes are automatically set up upon survey creation. These attributes can be viewed in the Interaction Studio platform under Settings > Attributes > Survey Attributes. The attributes become visible on the individual User profile only after a survey event in the specified format is received (see Sending a Survey Event ). Once the survey event is received by Interaction Studio, the responses are stored within the corresponding Surveys attributes. The event requires surveyId , surveyStartTime , and all the Surveys attributes representing a user's responses to questions in the survey. Each Surveys attribute will be stored in the below format: survey:<surveyId>:<questionId>:<rowId> or survey:<surveyId>:<questionId> <surveyId> and <questionId> are generated by Interaction Studio. <rowId> is used for Matrix questions, but is otherwise omitted. By default, there is a limit of 10 Surveys attributes. Sending a Survey Event \u00b6 The Surveys Gear automatically handles survey submissions and sends the survey event in the required format. As a developer, it is not necessary to include any code that sends a survey event within the Template. The following example shows how to track a survey event in case the need to bypass the built-in tracking should arise. Please note that it is not recommended to track a Surveys event outside of the Surveys Gear. Evergage.sendEvent({ source: { surveyId: \"string\" surveyStartTime: \"string\" }, user: { attributes: { \"survey:<surveyId>:<questionId>:<rowId>\": \"string\" } } }) Styling Surveys \u00b6 There are a few different options available for styling surveys, many of which can be found in the SurveyJS documentation, such as for using Custom CSS and creating a Custom Theme . Below is an example for applying custom styling with client-side JavaScript using the applyTheme function: function apply(context, template) { const contentZoneSelector = Evergage.getContentZoneSelector(context.contentZone); return Evergage.DisplayUtils .bind(buildBindId(context)) .pageElementLoaded(contentZoneSelector) .then(element => { const $survey = Evergage.cashDom(template(context).trim()); return Evergage.Surveys.injectSurveyResourcesIntoPage().then(()=>{ Survey.StylesManager.applyTheme(\"default\"); return Evergage.Surveys.renderSurvey(context.survey, $survey).then(() => { Evergage.cashDom(element).append($survey); }); }); }); } Stats Tracking \u00b6 If using the example template below in a Campaign, an impression stat will automatically be tracked when the initial page of the survey is rendered. To track any other additional stats, please see Campaign Stats Tracking for information about how to do so.

You can use URLs generated by your Interaction Studio OTE campaigns to import item images or link to catalog items within your externally managed email campaigns. You'll still use the Interaction Studio UI to create new open-time email campaigns . However, you won't need to copy over all the generated HTML into your email template. Instead, you can cherry-pick item and item image URLs from your OTE campaign and embed them in your email template. This article describes how and where to find URLs within an Interaction Studio OTE campaign to copy into your email marketing system. This article assumes that you have created or cloned an OTE campaign, thoroughly tested it, and have the HTML code for the campaign open in front of you. To know more about viewing the HTML for your OTE campaign, see Capture the URL . Capture URLs from Campaign HTML \u00b6 The following code sample depicts HTML generated by an example Interaction Studio OTE campaign. **Note:** - In messages that contain more than one content block (such as this sample campaign), the URL for each block differs by one number only. - The sample code includes the combined code for all the item blocks in the campaign. You can combine all HTML blocks in your campaign by clicking **COMBINE ALL HTML BLOCKS** when viewing the generated HTML in the UI. - The characters used after `userId` in the sample code are for simulation purposes only. Do not copy these characters into your email marketing solution. <!-- start Interaction Studio promotion block (Jane Dress Free Shipping Promo) --> <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"100%\" align=\"center\"> <div class=\"evergage-block\" style=\"max-height: 311px; max-width: 660px; position: relative; overflow: hidden;\"> <a href=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE1/1/detail?userId=@@USER_ID@@\"> <img src=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE1/1/summary.png?userId=@@USER_ID@@\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Get free shipping on Jane\"> </a> </div> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <!-- end Interaction Studio promotion block (Jane Dress Free Shipping Promo) --> <!-- start Interaction Studio Recommendations block (Item Recommendations Row 1) --> <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"100%\"> <div class=\"evergage-block\" style=\"max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%; position: relative; overflow: hidden; text-align: center;\"> <div class=\"evergage-recs\" style=\"display: table; width: 100%; max-height: 100%;\"> <span class=\"evergage-rec\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"> <a href=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE2/1/detail?userId=@@USER_ID@@\"> <img src=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE2/1/summary.png?userId=@@USER_ID@@\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Item image\"> </a> </span> <span class=\"evergage-rec\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"> <a href=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE2/2/detail?userId=@@USER_ID@@\"> <img src=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE2/2/summary.png?userId=@@USER_ID@@\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Item image\"> </a> </span> <span class=\"evergage-rec\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"> <a href=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE2/3/detail?userId=@@USER_ID@@\"> <img src=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE2/3/summary.png?userId=@@USER_ID@@\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Item image\"> </a> </span> </div> </div> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <!-- end Interaction Studio Recommendations block (Item Recommendations Row 1) --> <!-- start Interaction Studio Recommendations block (Item Recommendations Row 2) --> <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"100%\"> <div class=\"evergage-block\" style=\"max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%; position: relative; overflow: hidden; text-align: center;\"> <div class=\"evergage-recs\" style=\"display: table; width: 100%; max-height: 100%;\"> <span class=\"evergage-rec\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"> <a href=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE3/1/detail?userId=@@USER_ID@@\"> <img src=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE3/1/summary.png?userId=@@USER_ID@@\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"> </a> </span> <span class=\"evergage-rec\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"> <a href=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE3/2/detail?userId=@@USER_ID@@\"> <img src=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE3/2/summary.png?userId=@@USER_ID@@\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"> </a> </span> <span class=\"evergage-rec\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"> <a href=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE3/3/detail?userId=@@USER_ID@@\"> <img src=\"https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/retail/campaign/PTJqe/zIjE3/3/summary.png?userId=@@USER_ID@@\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"> </a> </span> </div> </div> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <!-- end Interaction Studio Recommendations block (Item Recommendations Row 2) --> To copy over URLs from the above sample campaign HTML, do the following. 1.

Adding UTM parameters to URLs in your email campaigns can give you much more detailed insights into your campaign's performance. While you can rely on Interaction Studio for analytics and full campaign performance reporting, you can still use your existing web analytics system to monitor click-through traffic with your Open-Time Email campaigns. To learn more about how you can combine third-party tracking data with data from Interaction Studio, please speak with your Salesforce account representative. This article describes how to use UTM parameters with Open-Time Emails. To know more about Open-Time Emails or how to create one, read the Email Campaigns documentation. This article assumes that you have created or cloned an Open-Time Email campaign, fully tested it, and have the HTML code for the campaign open in front of you. Adding UTM Parameters to Your Emails \u00b6 To add UTM parameters to your emails, do the following. 1. Access the Open-Time Email campaign within the Campaign Edit screen in Interaction Studio UI. For detailed instructions on accessing the Campaign Edit screen, refer to the Access the Campaign Edit Screen article in the Interaction Studio Knowledge Base. 1. Click SIMULATE > Show HTML . 1. Identify the URLs you'd like to track in your email campaign. You'd most likely want to track URLs for item recommendations included in your email template along with any other URLs of importance. 1. Append UTM parameters at the end of each of the identified URLs, starting with and separated by the & symbol. For example, if the URL of an item in your email is https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/engage/campaign/YnFdJ/N7pF1/1/detail?userId=@@USER_ID@@ , append the UTM parameters to the end of the URL as shown below. https://demo.evergage.com/api/dataset/engage/campaign/YnFdJ/N7pF1/1/detail?userId=%40%40USER_ID&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=lead_generation **Note:** - It is essential to add the `&` symbol before every UTM parameter in a URL. Excluding the `&` symbol breaks the URL and leads to improper tracking. After you've added UTM parameters to all the relevant URLs, you can use the updated campaign HTML with your existing email marketing solution to send your email campaign to recipients and track click-through rates in your web analytics system. Example \u00b6 The following code sample contains HTML for a row of three item recommendations in an Open-Time Email campaign. **Note:** - This sample HTML is for illustrative purposes only and includes an illustrative dynamic variable `@@USER_ID@@` for `userId`. The dynamic variable your email marketing solution uses may differ. - The item and item image URLs in your Open-Time Email campaign may require modification depending on your email marketing solution.

You\u2019ll notice that in the server-side template configurator, the content zone selector pane is not present. Quick details around the differences in how Content Zone(s) are used for web and Server-Side campaigns are as follows: Web Campaigns: \u00b6 The Content Zone selector in a web campaign is required since Interaction Studio is responsible for rendering the campaign. A template developer can assign Content Zone(s) to templates to determine where a particular template is allowed to be used on the site by a business user A business user targets a campaign to a specific Content Zone on the site and then can apply published templates that were tagged with that Content Zone by their template developer By linking web templates to specific Content Zone(s), a template developer is ensuring that Interaction Studio will render the experience correctly, as the template was designed to work on that particular part of the site Server-Side Campaigns: \u00b6 In a server-side campaign execution, the client takes responsibility for rendering the response payload returned by Interaction Studio. Since the output of a server-side campaign is simply a data payload, Content Zone selection is not required for template creation or campaign targeting. In a server-side campaign execution, it is up to the client to: Determine what data is required to be passed back as part of the campaign response (defined in server-side template) Apply the template to a campaign with appropriate targeting logic (Server-Side Campaign) Call Interaction Studio\u2019s Event API and take the data that is returned in the campaign response object and render it in the correct location/format For clients that have implemented the IS web SDK (with content zones defined in the sitemap) and are utilizing Server-Side campaigns to power personalized experiences, Content Zones can be leveraged as a means to tie a server-side campaign to a specific location on the site. Much like how a web campaign will only return if the Content Zone is present on the page, a server-side campaign that utilizes content zone targeting will also only return if the targeted content zone is present in the request. To add a content zone to your server-side template, all that is required is a basic adjustment to the server-side code (the content zone selector pane that is used for web campaigns is not available for Server-Side campaigns). In the server-side code, just add the line contentZone: \u201ccontentZone1\u201d | \u201ccontentZone2\u201d... Adding more than one Content Zone option will create the Content Zone drop-down selector in the business user template config. The number of Content Zones a template is eligible for is up to the template developer. Once a Content Zone is added to a Server-Side template, it is important to make sure that your API calling patterns are configured correctly. Specifically, you will need to have contentZones included on the source object in the Event API request. A template with a contentZone applied will only return a response if its targeted contentZone is present in the Event API request. Additionally, only one campaign response per contentZone will be returned. This means if you have two campaigns targeting the same Content Zone and the user is eligible for both, only one campaign will return. A business user can easily prioritize which campaign returns by assigning a priority value to the campaign in the campaign configuration screen. As noted by the info icon next to the priority input box (found in the campaign type window of the campaign creation screen), Campaigns with a higher numeric priority will take precedence. If campaigns share a priority value, the campaign that was created first wins. The ONLY time a Content Zone value in the server-side code is required as part of a server-side campaign is for promotion selection / decisioning purposes. Einstein Decisions requires that a Content Zone or tag is defined in order to filter which promotion assets are eligible to be returned as part of the campaign response. The Content Zone or tag that you want to use as part of the Einstein Decisions template would need to be hardcoded into the server-side template code.

This article outlines the crucial difference between the two templates spanning two key parts of the template: what content zone or tag the bandit leverages for decision-making and what data on the promotion is returned. Global Web Template \u00b6 Content Zone or Tag Selection: context.contentZone \u00b6 The Global Web Template leverages context.contentZone to determine which promotion content zone Einstein Decisions should evaluate for a decision. The context.contentZone value maps to the targeted web content zone of the template, meaning the targeted web content zone serves the following two purposes. Determining where the Einstein Decisions template is allowed to render on the site Filtering which promotions are eligible to be returned by the template (only promotions with an asset that has a content zone or tag that maps to the targeted web content zone will be eligible for decision-making) To configure the targeted web content zone, you can use the Content Zones in Template selector in the Web Template Editor to select a single value or define a set of values for business users to pick from via a drop-down menu. By leveraging context.contentZone in the template, you effectively restrict which promotions can be returned. Since the content zone selector pane in the web template editor only displays web content zones defined in the sitemap, only promotions with an asset tied to a web content zone will be eligible to return. Campaign Response: Image URL and Promotion URL \u00b6 The Global Web Template returns the primary data required for client-side rendering. In this case, the template is set to return just the image URL for the selected asset and the promotion URL. You can easily configure additional promotion attributes/information to return via the web template. Server-Side Template \u00b6 Content Zone or Tag Selection: ContentZoneLookup \u00b6 The server-side iteration of the template gives you a little more flexibility. Since the content zone selector pane leveraged in web templates is not available in the server-side template interface, you will use ContentZoneLookup instead of referencing context.contentZone . Unlike the web content zone selector, ContentZoneLookup is not restricted to only content zones defined in the sitemap. Instead, it enables a business user to select any content zone or tag value stored against a promotion asset or defined in the sitemap. The value that a business user selects will be the promotion content zone or tag that Einstein Decisions then leverages for real-time evaluation and decision-making. Campaign Response: Full Promotion \u00b6 Since Interaction Studio is not responsible for rendering the decision passed back via a server-side campaign, the Server-Side template is designed to return all promotion information for the selected promotion by default. You can easily restrict what is returned in the response if the complete promotion data is not required. Additionally, since the complete promotion data is being returned, as opposed to asset-specific data like an image URL, a business user will only need to define a fallback promotion as opposed to a fallback promotion along with a fallback asset.

The Event API will return campaign responses for all server-side campaigns where the campaign targeting criteria is met. For example, if you have 3 personalizations on a single page, a client could simply ensure the following to return multiple campaign responses at once: All 3 campaigns are published A user qualifies for all 3 campaigns If the above criteria is met, the Interaction Studio Event API will return 3 campaign responses in the single call. The client is responsible for parsing the campaign response data and determining which campaign response to display and where on the page or end system to display. As the number of campaigns a client is running increases, it is important to understand that the number of campaigns returned in a single response can impact latency. Factors that can impact latency include: Number of campaigns being returned in a single call Amount of data being returned by each campaign Complexity of the queries leveraged within each campaign (Einstein Recipes, Einstein Decisions, etc.) A best practice to consider when returning multiple campaigns in a single request is to limit what is returned to what can be visibly rendered to the end user and load campaigns that are below the fold in subsequent calls as they come into view. Additionally, to ensure that you are only ever returning the necessary campaigns for a response, we strongly recommend validating that your campaigns utilize appropriate targeting logic (like page targeting). Without proper targeting logic, you run the risk of unnecessarily returning more campaigns than required and ultimately negatively impacting overall performance.","title":"Multiple Server Side Campaign Responses in a Single Call"},{"location":"campaign-development/server-side-campaigns-and-templates/server-side-templates/","text":"Interaction Studio allows business users to build Server-Side campaigns and templates using a streamlined version of the web templates editor and the same campaign builder that you are familiar with from web campaigns. By leveraging the same campaign builder and the same underlying template infrastructure, clients can more easily extend campaigns across channels and even build a single campaign that can be called by multiple applications. Server-Side campaigns are available to premium edition clients. Login to Interaction Studio \u00b6 Login to your Interaction Studio Account Navigate to the dataset where you want to build your Server-Side campaign Create a New Server-Side Campaign \u00b6 Select Server-Side from the left-hand navigation in the Channels & Campaigns section This will take you a screen where you can view all of your published & disabled Server-Side campaigns (published campaigns have bolded names, unpublished are not bolded) To create a new campaign, click the New Campaign button in the upper right. a. When you create a new Server-Side campaign, it will open the campaign interface and have a campaign targeting rule of channel: Server applied by default. The campaign level channel: Server rule means that by default, a Server-Side campaign will require the /authevent API endpoint and an API token in order for a response to be returned. It will also reference the ID attribute configured for the Event API in the dataset settings screen. b. Campaign targeting rules are configurable by the business user. More information about channel targeting is provided in the Apply Targeting Logic section below. NOTE: Creating a new Server-Side campaign using the Classic editor documented here is no longer supported for clients leveraging the campaigns & templates system. If you have existing Server-Side classic campaigns, they will continue to function and you will still be able to access and edit those campaigns, but you will not be able to create a new one. Both rule-based and A/B tests provide options for a control experience. With A/B tests, you determine control traffic using a slider; with rules-based campaigns you enter a control percentage in an input field. Determine the Campaign Type \u00b6 There are two campaign types. A/B Test campaigns split traffic randomly into different groups based on percentages you define. Each group sees a different campaign experience. Rule Based Test campaigns follow the rules you define to determine which experience to show to each visitor. For example, using a rule-based test, you could target a segment of visitors who had not been to your site in 30 days and show them experience 1, then show experience 2 to visitors who had been to your site in the last 24 hours. The default campaign type is A/B Test Click > next to A/B Test Choose the campaign type that supports your goal for the campaign a. A/B Test b. Rule-based 4. Toggle between A/B Test and Rule Based Test to change the type Create and Name Campaign Experiences \u00b6 Determine how many experiences you want to have for your campaign. If you want to deliver a different campaign experience to various groups of qualified visitors, create additional experiences by cloning the configured experience. Then you can make modifications to the next experience using the same template, or apply a different template as needed. Still in Campaign Type , click the following icon to clone an experience Double click the Experience Name to change the name Repeat the cloning and renaming process until you have the number of experiences you need for your campaign The name of each experience shows up in your campaign statistics report. It can be helpful to name each experience with what is unique about that experience so you can interpret the results in reporting. For example, if you are building a cross-channel campaign, it is helpful to name each experience with their respective channel name (eg. Mobile, POS, Web, etc.) For rules-based campaigns, if a user that qualifies for the campaign qualifies for multiple experiences, the experience higher in the list of experiences is considered the higher priority experience. You can drag and reorder campaign experiences on the campaign type screen. Determine Campaign Identity & Authentication Requirements \u00b6 Server-Side campaigns have the same targeting options available as web campaigns. There is, however, important nuance around the channel rule that has identity and authentication implications. As described above, Server-Side campaigns have campaign level targeting logic of channel: Server applied by default. While a business user can choose to remove this logic, its inclusion means that the campaign will require an authenticated request via the /authevent endpoint with channel set to Server in the call in order to return a campaign response. Additional information around the implications for using or removing the channel: Server logic is as follows: Authenticated Campaigns: channel: Server Rule: Authentication: Any time channel: Server is present (at either the campaign level or experience level) it means that authentication will be required in order for Interaction Studio to return a campaign response, as Server is a default \"Trusted\" channel. (If your Interaction Studio account was provisioned prior to 1/28/2021, you might need to file a support ticket to get channel: Server added as a trusted channel) API Calling Pattern: The inbound request that includes channel: Server MUST leverage the /authevent endpoint and include an API token. Information on the /authevent endpoint and creating an API token in Interaction Studio are available at their respective links. If a POST request is made to the authevent endpoint without either channel: Server or an API token included, no campaign response data will be returned. Identity: When channel \u2192 Server is applied to a POST request that goes through the /authevent endpoint, the id value provided will reference the Event API identity attribute that is configured via the identity settings screen (instructions / details on the API identity attribute configuration is available here ). The configured value is the only value that can be used for user lookup via the authevent endpoint and if any other identity attributes are included in the call, they will be ignored. Unauthenticated Campaigns: channel: Web Rule Authentication: If the default channel: Server campaign level rule is removed, you can update a user and get campaign responses returned without authentication. API Calling Pattern: The inbound request that includes channel: Web MUST leverage the /event endpoint. Information on the /event endpoint is available here . If a POST request is made to the /event endpoint with no channel value or a different channel value included, you will NOT be able to reference an identity attribute and might end up creating new users in the platform. Identity: When channel: Web is applied to an inbound request that goes through the /event endpoint, the user.id value provided will reference the Web SDK identity attribute that is configured via the identity settings screen (instructions / details on the Web SDK identity attribute configuration is available here ). More than one identity attribute can be included in the user.attributes object in order to facilitate additional profile merge scenarios. Note that this behavior is different than the /authevent endpoint above. Hybrid Authenticated & Unauthenticated Campaigns: While A/B/n testing campaigns can ONLY be either fully authenticated or unauthenticated, rules based campaigns provide additional flexibility via experience level rules. By removing the default campaign level channel: Server rule, you can make certain experiences within a campaign either require or not require authentication. To do this, simply apply either channel: Server or channel: Web as a rule on the experience. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you decide to mix channel: Web & channel: Server logic into a single campaign, make sure the correct endpoints and Id values are being used in the call for the respective experiences. **Channel Support** If you include a channel value in the campaign targeting logic that is not either Web or Server, you will NOT be able to access identity attributes. Web & Server are the only channel values with identity support. Create Application Specific Experiences \u00b6 There are a couple different ways for a user to build a single Server-Side campaign that can power experiences across multiple touch-points. Restrict Campaign Response to Certain Applications at the Campaign Level: If you want to limit a campaign response to only certain applications, you can layer in additional targeting rules via the Source \u2192 Application rule. By applying this rule, an inbound request needs to include one of the applications listed on the campaign rule (eg. Mobile, POS, Support, etc.) in order for a response to be returned. This type of targeting helps ensure you are only returning campaign responses relevant to that particular application. Application Specific Experiences: If you want to build different experiences for different applications, a business user would simply leverage a rules based campaign and then apply application targeting logic to the experience. To apply application targeting logic, simply apply an application rule at the experience level (eg. Mobile or POS). The application will be required in the inbound call in order to return the experience designed for that specific application. Apply a Template \u00b6 Once you have created a new campaign, added a name for the campaign, and applied your targeting logic, it's time to apply a template. At the left, under your first experience, click Add Template In the Select Template window, you will see all published Server-Side templates. Once selected, the template name will appear under the experience and the business user can fill in the configuration options that the template developer has exposed Test Experiences \u00b6 To test a Server-Side campaign that is built from template, you will need to use a tool to make POST requests. For campaigns that require authentication, you will need access to an API token. The campaign response generated by Interaction Studio is the same format as the response generated for web campaigns using the campaign and templates system. If you are unsure about your API Token review with your Interaction Studio account administrator and review the documentation here. Create a new API POST request, The formatting of this POST URL is as follows: Authenticated: /api2/authevent/{dataset} Unauthenticated: /api2/event/{dataset} To test a campaign or experience where channel: Server is included requires an API token in order to return a response. By default, a Server-Side campaign has channel: Server configured in the campaign targeting logic meaning campaign responses will only return for authenticated requests. (If you removed the channel: Server logic, you need to reference the /event endpoint for unauthenticated posts/responses) If using the /authevent endpoint you will need to leverage Basic Auth & enter your API token credentials your Key is the Username and the Secret as the Password The Body content of the request must be constructed as JSON There are two types of test requests that you can submit (sample calls available to copy/paste below): a. testMessages: true this configuration will allow you to test that the campaign targeting rules are being adhered to correctly. Only users that qualify for the campaign and all of the targeting logic will be eligible to receive a campaign response. If they do not qualify, the request will not return any campaign response information. The campaign MUST be in a published state in order to test that rules are being adhered to correctly. We recommend testing this in a separate dataset prior to moving the template to a campaign on the production dataset (remember templates can be easily transferred between datasets by downloading and uploading the template zip file). b. testMessages: experienceId In this configuration, you would replace the experienceId text with the id of the campaign experience your are looking to test (see image on the right to learn how to find your campaign experience id). Testing in this manner will IGNORE campaign rules, but allows you to validate the campaign response data looks correct. By including a specific experience ID, you ARE able to test an unpublished campaign experience. Testing a specific experience can ONLY be done via the /authevent endpoint. This means that if you have an unauthenticated campaign leveraging the channel:Web rule, in order to test the campaign response for a specific experience while the campaign is unpublished, you still need to use channel:Server in the POST. Sample authevent API POST Request { \"action\": \"hello world\", \"debug\": { \"testMessages\": \"true\" }, \"user\": { \"id\": \"sample Id\" }, \"source\": { \"channel\":\"Server\", \"application\":\"POS\" } } **Note:** the id value you select for a user will look for a user in the system based on the identity attribute that you have assigned to the Event API. Instructions/information on selecting the identity attribute for the Event API [is available here](https://doc.evergage.com/display/EKB/Configure+the+Identity+System+for+the+Event+API) testMessages: experienceId To find your campaigns experience Id, simply open the Server-Side campaign list screen, select the campaign you are intending to test and scroll down to the Overview section. You will see the experience Id next to the eye icon on the right side of the page (reference screenshot with highlighted value below). In order to test a specific experience, a trusted channel MUST be included in the call. This ensures that ignoring campaign rules does not ignore authentication requirements. Sample authevent API POST Request { \"action\": \"hello world\", \"debug\": { \"testMessages\": \"experienceId\" }, \"user\": { \"id\": \"sample UserId\" }, \"source\": { \"channel\":\"Server\" } } Publish the Campaign \u00b6 Once you have thoroughly tested your campaign, you need to publish it to make it live. The process for publishing a campaign can be done on the campaign list page or while editing the campaign. While editing your campaign in the campaign editor, save any changes The SAVE button will dim to let you know all changes have been saved Slide the toggle to PUBLISHED You will receive a confirmation message that the campaign was published To disable a campaign, slide the toggle to DISABLED Again, you will receive a confirmation message that the campaign was unpublished **Campaign Access Controls** If you want to know who has access to publish a campaign (or edit or create a new campaign) refer to [the roles based access guide](https://doc.evergage.com/display/EKB/Add%2C+Edit%2C+and+Delete+Users+and+Roles). Roles-based access is a great way to ensure that campaigns go through the proper approval process prior to publishing for live traffic. Server-Side campaign & template creation follows the same permissions associated with web campaigns & templates. Track Campaign Results \u00b6 To track campaign stats on a Server-Side campaign, you will need to work with your web developer to pass stats information like impressions, clicks, items returned, etc. back via API. Information on how to pass campaign stats back to Interaction Studio is available here on our developer documentation site. The stats will appear in the campaigns statistics report that is automatically generated for the campaign.","title":"Server-Side Templates"},{"location":"campaign-development/server-side-campaigns-and-templates/server-side-templates/#login-to-interaction-studio","text":"Login to your Interaction Studio Account Navigate to the dataset where you want to build your Server-Side campaign","title":"Login to Interaction Studio"},{"location":"campaign-development/server-side-campaigns-and-templates/server-side-templates/#create-a-new-server-side-campaign","text":"Select Server-Side from the left-hand navigation in the Channels & Campaigns section This will take you a screen where you can view all of your published & disabled Server-Side campaigns (published campaigns have bolded names, unpublished are not bolded) To create a new campaign, click the New Campaign button in the upper right. a. When you create a new Server-Side campaign, it will open the campaign interface and have a campaign targeting rule of channel: Server applied by default. The campaign level channel: Server rule means that by default, a Server-Side campaign will require the /authevent API endpoint and an API token in order for a response to be returned. It will also reference the ID attribute configured for the Event API in the dataset settings screen. b. Campaign targeting rules are configurable by the business user. More information about channel targeting is provided in the Apply Targeting Logic section below. NOTE: Creating a new Server-Side campaign using the Classic editor documented here is no longer supported for clients leveraging the campaigns & templates system. If you have existing Server-Side classic campaigns, they will continue to function and you will still be able to access and edit those campaigns, but you will not be able to create a new one.

It can be helpful to name each experience with what is unique about that experience so you can interpret the results in reporting. For example, if you are building a cross-channel campaign, it is helpful to name each experience with their respective channel name (eg. Mobile, POS, Web, etc.) For rules-based campaigns, if a user that qualifies for the campaign qualifies for multiple experiences, the experience higher in the list of experiences is considered the higher priority experience.

There is, however, important nuance around the channel rule that has identity and authentication implications. As described above, Server-Side campaigns have campaign level targeting logic of channel: Server applied by default. While a business user can choose to remove this logic, its inclusion means that the campaign will require an authenticated request via the /authevent endpoint with channel set to Server in the call in order to return a campaign response. Additional information around the implications for using or removing the channel: Server logic is as follows: Authenticated Campaigns: channel: Server Rule: Authentication: Any time channel: Server is present (at either the campaign level or experience level) it means that authentication will be required in order for Interaction Studio to return a campaign response, as Server is a default \"Trusted\" channel. (If your Interaction Studio account was provisioned prior to 1/28/2021, you might need to file a support ticket to get channel: Server added as a trusted channel) API Calling Pattern: The inbound request that includes channel: Server MUST leverage the /authevent endpoint and include an API token. Information on the /authevent endpoint and creating an API token in Interaction Studio are available at their respective links.

If the user is in a \"Test\" group, a template's clientside code will execute the apply() function. Likewise, if the user in the \"Control\" group, a template's clientside code will execute the control() function. Both functions can return a Promise . Once these Promise s resolve, Interaction Studio will dispatch an Evergage.CustomEvents.OnTemplateDisplayEnd event and campaign statistics will be tracked automatically. Note that the \"Control\" experience does not necessarily need to render HTML into the DOM for the Campaign Stats Gear to track a \"Control\" impression. Use without Handlebars and Clientside Code \u00b6 If your site does not use Handlebars and Clientside Code in an Interaction Studio template to render campaigns, you can still use the Campaign Stats Gear to track campaign statistics. When you are ready to track an impression for an Interaction Studio campaign, dispatch an Evergage.CustomEvents.OnTemplateDisplayEnd event with the following detail { payload: { campaign: string, experience: string, userGroup: string } } See the code snippet below for dispatching an Evergage.CustomEvents.OnTemplateDisplayEnd event with an example payload outlined above document.dispatchEvent( new CustomEvent(window.Evergage.CustomEvents.OnTemplateDisplayEnd, { detail: { payload: { campaign: \"abc12\", experience: \"def34\", userGroup: \"Test\" } } }) ); Control Click Tracking \u00b6 In order to track clicks in the control group, the data attributes must be added to elements that are either rendered by the campaign, or exist on site and a user in the control group would see. See the code snippet below for adding these attributes in the control() function. function control(context) { Evergage.cashDom(\"SELECTOR\").attr({ \"data-evg-campaign-id\": context.campaign, \"data-evg-experience-id\": context.experience, \"data-evg-user-group\": context.userGroup }); } If you're using a DisplayUtil such as pageElementLoaded in the template's apply function, then you might want to similarly use it in the control function to ensure that campaign stats are being tracked in a similar manner. function control(context) { const contentZoneSelector = Evergage.getContentZone(context.contentZone); return Evergage.DisplayUtils .bind(`${context.campaign}:${context.experience}`) .pageElementLoaded(contentZoneSelector) .then((element) => { Evergage.cashDom(\"SELECTOR\").attr({ \"data-evg-campaign-id\": context.campaign, \"data-evg-experience-id\": context.experience, \"data-evg-user-group\": context.userGroup }); }); } Sending Campaign Stats without the Campaign Stats Gear \u00b6 Evergage.sendStat accepts a CampaignStatEvent . CampaignStatEvent \u00b6 { campaignStats: CampaignStat[]; } CampaignStat \u00b6 { experienceId: string, stat: 'Impression' | 'Clickthrough' | 'Dismissal', control: boolean, catalog: { [itemTypeKey: string]: string[] } } See the code snippet below for using Evergage.sendStat to send a CampaignStatEvent event with recommended items. const stat = { experienceId: \"def34\", stat: \"Impression\", control: false, catalog: { Product: [\"product1\", \"product2\"] } } Evergage.sendStat({ campaignStats: [stat] }); Sending Campaign Stats to Third Parties \u00b6 The following documentation outlines how to listen for and how to access the data of campaign stat events from Interaction Studio.

This guide takes you through modifying the Interaction Studio \"Global Template: Slide-in With Call-To-Action\", and its associated use cases. Slide-in With Call-To-Action Global Template \u00b6 Using the \"Slide-in With Call-To-Action\" global template, you can deliver attention-grabbing slide-in messages that include a CTA to customers and prospects. You can choose from various trigger options, such as time on page, scroll depth, and inactivity, that determine when the message should appear. Template Configuration \u00b6 The following steps describe how to configure the Slide-in With CTA global template. 1. In your sitemap, include content zones to target the \"Slide-in With Call-To-Action\" template. Consider the following when determining your content zone. - This template will not replace the selected content zone/selector. - This content zone must be present on all pages where the template should render. - Interaction Studio JS can render one campaign per content zone and renders the campaign with the highest priority. **Note:** As a best practice, create a unique global content zone, such as `global_slide_in`, as shown in the following sample code. ```js const config = { global: { contentZones: [ {name: \"global_slide_in\", selector: \"body > div.category-menu\"}, ] } } ``` Clone the Slide-in With CTA template global template and name it. By default, the cloned template will be named [CLONED] Global template name . Under Template Settings , apply the content zone(s) added during site mapping to the template using the Content Zones in Template selector. 1. Optional: In the Serverside Code tab, configure what is shown or made available in the template to the business user. For example, you can add additional scroll depth percentage options that the business user can select from when they're configuring the campaign. The following image illustrates how you can set scroll depth percentages in the Serverside Code . 1. Optional: Configure the look and feel of the slide-in based on business requirements using template handlebars and CSS. The following unique styling options are available for the Slide-In With Call-To-Action template. - animation-duration : Determines the time in seconds for the slide-in animation to complete - keyframes : Determines the starting and ending position of the slide-in animation (the direction from which the slide-in slides in). The following code depicts example CSS that styles the slide-in element and handlebars that animates it to slide in from the left side of the page. ```css #evg-slide-in-with-cta { position: fixed; z-index: 1000000; top: auto !important; left: 5%; bottom: 10vh !important; right: auto; width: 300px; height: 300px; border: 1px solid #000; color: #fff; background-color: #000; font-family: inherit; animation-name: slideInDesktopMessage; animation-duration: 1s; } @keyframes slideInDesktopMessage { from { left: -90%; } to { left: 5%; } } ``` The code above slides in the slide-in element from the left side (-90% to 5%) of the page.

The first parameter is the context , in the form of a JavaScript object. This is the payload that is returned from the server-side code of the Serverside Code tab. The second parameter, template , is a function that expects the context as an argument to resolve with the Handlebars template, returning the generated HTML content.

Reset \u00b6 reset(context: Object, template: Function) => void The reset function is called when the template should be removed from the DOM. Interaction Studio does not call this on your website from the Web SDK at any part of the lifecycle of a campaign, but it is utilized by the Interaction Studio Visual Editor when developing a template.

To use a global template, follow the steps below: Clone the global template that most closely represents your web channel use case. Customize the template to meet the business user requirements. The following sections present the steps for cloning a global template in Interaction Studio and the best practices for customizing global template code. For information on the most current list of available global templates and their recommended web channel use cases, see Work with Global Templates in the Interaction Studio business user knowledge base. Cloning a Global Template \u00b6 To clone a global template, do the following: 1. Open the Interaction Studio Launcher Chrome extension tool, and click the View List section of the template button: Click the Global Templates tab to find a list of all currently available global templates. To clone a global template for customization, click the Clone Global Template button associated with the global template you want to customize. Cloning a global template will open a new copy of the template, with the text \"[CLONE]\" prepended to the template name. Note: Cloning and customizing a global template does not alter the original version of the global template in the Global Templates tab. You can make as many clones of a global template as you require for different use cases. Note: In global templates, comments are provided at the top of the code tabs to help template developers effectively customize the template. For an example of this, see the comments in the Handlebars tab in the above [CLONE] Einstein Product Recommendations figure. Click Save to save the cloned version of the global template to your dataset. This cloned version will appear in the Templates tab along with any other templates you have created or cloned. Customizing the Template \u00b6 Once you have cloned a global template as described in the preceding section, customize the template components to meet the requirements of the business use case. As a best practice, we recommend you modify the template component code in the following order: Modify the server-side code in the Serverside Code tab. See Web Template Server TypeScript for more detail. Modify the client-side code in the Clientside Code tab. See Web Template Client JavaScript for more detail. Develop the Handlebars templated HTML code in the Handlebars tab. See Web Template Handlebars for more detail. Develop the CSS style code in the CSS tab. See Web Template CSS for more detail. Template Developer Best Practices \u00b6 Developers customizing global templates should follow the best practices outlined in the following articles: Web Templates Style Guide and Coding Conventions provides a guide to writing consistent template code.

Handlebars Templated HTML \u00b6 Handlebars is a simple HTML templating language that uses a template and an input object to generate HTML. A handlebars expression is an opening double-brace {{ , some contents, followed by a closing double-brace }} . Here is an example of a simple handlebars expression: <p>{{firstname}} {{lastname}}</p> In creating templates, developers enter Handlebars template code in the Handlebars tab of the template editor. When a Handlebars template within an Interaction Studio web template is executed, each Handlebars expression is replaced with values from the specified input object. In Interaction Studio web templates, the template variables in the Handlebars expressions are populated by the Web Template Context provided by the Client JavaScript objects specified in the Clientside Code tab.","title":"Web Template Handlebars"},{"location":"campaign-development/templates/template-handlebars/#handlebars-templated-html","text":"Handlebars is a simple HTML templating language that uses a template and an input object to generate HTML.

You can simulate the template response for an event by providing details about the event, such as the user a campaign renders for and the current item in the event. This article outlines the components of the simulator and describes how you can leverage it to aid template development and testing. Simulator Components \u00b6 The payload simulator is located in the Payload Preview tab of the Template Editor and allows you to define the following components to simulate a campaign response. User : In the User field, you can search for any user profile in Interaction Studio by their userId or username. The template response payload references the user you select in this field. Current Item Type & Current Item : These fields are only necessary if the campaign requires contextual data such as the item currently viewed (This is a common requirement for recipes like co-browse, co-buy, similar items, etc.) You can configure a Current Item only after selecting the Current Item Type . Simulating a Template Response \u00b6 To simulate a template, do the following. Enter the necessary simulator information in the User , Current Item Type , and Current Item fields. Enter the template configuration (the information a business user would provide while constructing a campaign). You can now view the template payload response in the Payload Preview section of the Payload Preview tab. Since the template configuration section has the Auto Render checkbox selected by default, any changes made to the template configuration or within the Simulator pane re-renders the template response payload.

While this tab is available on both Web and Server-Side templates, Server-Side templates will only have the Serverside Code tab and will not have the Handlebars , CSS , or Clientside Code tabs. Additionally, Server-Side templates do not have a content zone to target; you can only leverage them in the corresponding Server-Side Campaigns. Template Context Schema and Code Execution \u00b6 The content displayed in a template is driven by data that we refer to as the context. The Server-Side code (written in TypeScript) is responsible for defining this context and serves two primary purposes: Define the template interface configuration schema, which constructs the shape of the template's context Executes code on the server that allows for the population of the context with additional data available in Interaction Studio and any enabled Gears extensions The template's context is a payload that returns from the server-side containing the necessary catalog and user data to render a campaign. In a Server-Side template, Interaction Studio can issue this data as a JSON payload. In a web template, the context derived on the server is transmitted to the client browser. In the browser, the client-side JavaScript can choose what to do with the context , including using the values from context to dynamically build the HTML from the template's Handlebars tab and rendering logic defined in the Clientside Code tab. Template Class Structure \u00b6 A template is a class that extends CampaignTemplate and implements a single run method. export class ExampleTemplate implements CampaignTemplate { @title(\"Example Field\") header: string; run(context:CampaignComponentContext) { return {}; } } Template Interface Config \u00b6 The properties of the template's class are used to generate a configuration UI that is displayed to a business user when working in the campaign editor. The business user fills out the template's config inputs in the Campaign Editor to contextualize the template. Examples of items a template developer might expose to a business user in the template config include: Text input fields for experience messaging Recipe dropdown selectors for ML-driven recommendation campaigns Display timing logic Styling (text color, image background, font, etc.) For more information on the configuration system and all possible UI inputs, refer to the Interface & Template Configuration documentation. Content Zones \u00b6 A content zone is effectively a \"hot spot\" for personalization. When configuring a template, the template developer defines the content zones where the template is eligible for use through the Content Zones in Template selector in the bottom left corner of the Template Editor. A business user can then only use a template for the area on the site that it was designed for. If a template has more than one content zone assigned (think of a Recommendations row that might exist on many pages), the business user can select which content zone they intend to target in the actual campaign. Content Zones are defined and mapped as part of the sitemap. A content zone can contain a CSS selector, which directly points to an element on that page. However, since a CSS selector is not required, the content zone can instead be used as a \"logical\" or \"global\" target on a page. For example, if a page is rendering popups that appear on top of the page, this is not linked to any specific CSS selector. If you would like to add additional content zones after the initial implementation, you can easily add them via the sitemap editor in the Interaction Studio visual editor. Adding content zones via the in-app Sitemap Editor WILL NOT allow them to appear as a selection option in the template editor. **Important:** Server-Side templates do not have a content zone selector in the template editor screen as server-side campaigns do not need content zones for campaign targeting. However, you can manually configure content zones on server-side templates to tie server-side campaigns to specific locations on the site. For more information on content zones with server-side campaigns, see [Server-Side Campaigns and Content Zones](https://developer.evergage.com/campaign-development/server-side-campaigns-and-templates/contentzones#server-side-campaigns). Run \u00b6 The run function executes on Interaction Studio servers when the template prepares to construct a JSON response. Here, you can manipulate the values of the context or add additional values not configured by the end-user. run(context: CampaignComponentContext) => Object) The object returned by the run function is merged with the context from the configured template. The return value of the run function will overwrite any fields from the template that share the same key. import { getDataFromGear } from \"mygear\"; export class MyTemplate implements CampaignTemplate { exampleField: string = \"default value\"; run(context:CampaignComponentContext) { return { additionalData: getDataFromGear(this.exampleField); }; } } this Object \u00b6 You can access any properties defined in the head of the class by prepending the variable with this . All properties defined will be added to the template's local instance of this in the run function. Any parameters created can be accessed for processing in the run function. Context Object \u00b6 The context object is an instance of CampaignComponentContext , the primary way to interact with Interaction Studio properties exposed to templates. The context object allows the template author to access the properties defined in the class. For more information on the context object, refer to the CampaignComponentContext documentation. The context object also allows access to the user object, including user attributes and services like recommendations if enabled ( context.services.recommendations ). All properties of the template's class are used to generate a configuration UI. This configuration UI is then displayed to a business user when selecting the template for use in an Interaction Studio campaign. The business user then completes the template's configuration inputs in the Campaign Editor to contextualize the template. For more information on the configuration system and all possible UI inputs, refer to the Interface & Template Configuration documentation. Server-Side TypeScript Example \u00b6 The following code sample is a server-side template that allows business users to configure a comma-separated list of user attributes to return in the payload. You can configure the list of attributes to return in the campaign that utilizes the template. export class NewTemplate implements CampaignTemplateComponent { @title(\"User Attributes To Retrieve\") @subtitle(\"Contents must be a Comma separated list\") userAttributes: string; run(context:CampaignComponentContext) { let attrs = this.userAttributes.split(\",\") let attributesToSend = {} attrs.filter((value) => { return context.user.attributes.hasOwnProperty(value); }).map((attributeName) => { attributesToSend[attributeName] = { value: context.user.attributes[attributeName] } }); return { attributes: attributesToSend }; } }","title":"Template Server TypeScript"},{"location":"campaign-development/templates/template-server-typescript/#template-context-schema-and-code-execution","text":"The content displayed in a template is driven by data that we refer to as the context.

A template developer has complete control over each component of the template and can determine which aspects of the campaign experience a business user can manipulate. Once a developer publishes a template for a business user to use in a campaign, it becomes a reusable tool in the business users optimization arsenal that allows a business to test and learn at speed. While developers can configure custom templates from scratch, Interaction Studio accounts are equipped with a variety of global templates specifically designed to cover some of the most common and powerful use cases. These templates require minimal edits to leverage out of the box or can act as the starting point for new template creation. The global templates are both great use case accelerators and living/breathing examples of template code in action. Additional information on the global templates is available here. Template Implementation Options \u00b6 Interaction Studio has two types of templates available for developers to configure: Web Templates: Web templates consist of four key parts (Server-Side Code, Client-Side Code, Handlebars, & CSS) and are used when Interaction Studio\u2019s Web SDK is responsible for rendering the campaign experience on the client's site. Web templates also leverage the web content zones that are mapped during the website implementation. They determine where a campaign can render on the website. Server-Side Templates: Server-Side templates only utilize server-side code and are used to simply pass a JSON payload with customer or campaign response data for another system to then take and render/ingest. Template Context \u00b6 The content displayed in templates is driven by data that we refer to as the context . The data in the context is derived server-side by Interaction Studio from the configuration of the campaign that is using the template. Once the context is derived on the server, it is passed to the client browser, where the client-side JavaScript can choose what to do with the context , including joining the context with the HTML and rendering. Template Components \u00b6 Information and instructions on how to approach each component of a template are included in the following documents: Template Handlebars Template CSS Template Client JavaScript Template Server TypeScript Global Web Templates \u00b6 Interaction Studio provides a number of pre-built global templates for common personalization use cases such as hero banners, popups, product recommendations, info bars, and many more. These templates are highly customizable to suit individual needs and can save developers a significant amount of time over creating a new template from scratch. New global templates are being developed and released regularly to meet a variety of web channel campaign use cases. The process for using a global web template involves the following steps: Choose the global template that most closely matches your business use case. Clone the template.

Overview \u00b6 In order to help prevent flicker as described above, Flicker Defender does the following: - Initially hides every content zone which has a selector by temporarily applying the visibility: hidden !important style to elements targeted by that selector - Each hidden content zone is then redisplayed depending on: - If it is not targeted by a Template/Campaign for which the user has qualified - Upon resolution of the Template/Campaign targeting it - When the redisplayTimeout is hit - If a page is not matched or if the Sitemap errors, all hidden content zones will reshow following the pageMatchTimeout While there is no limit for either of the timeout values, it is advised to stay under 10000ms (10 seconds). Additionally, pageMatchTimeout should be less than or equal to the redisplayTimeout , since redisplayTimeout ultimately decides when to reshow all hidden content. Timeout Configuration \u00b6 The below Flicker Defense timeout options are configurable from within Site-Wide JavaScript. setPageMatchTimeout(pageMatchTimeout: number = 1000): void pageMatchTimeout controls a maximum length of time should be waited for a page to be successfully matched before reshowing all hidden content // Example: Evergage.FlickerDefender.setPageMatchTimeout(2500); setRedisplayTimeout(redisplayTimeout: number = 2500): void redisplayTimeout controls the maximum length of time that content should ever be hidden // Example: Evergage.FlickerDefender.setRedisplayTimeout(5000); Please note that calls to setPageMatchTimeout and/or setRedisplayTimeout must be done before the call to Evergage.init() in Site-Wide JavaScript: // Example: if (typeof (Evergage.FlickerDefender || {}).setPageMatchTimeout === \"function\") { Evergage.FlickerDefender.setPageMatchTimeout(2500); } if (typeof (Evergage.FlickerDefender || {}).setRedisplayTimeout === \"function\") { Evergage.FlickerDefender.setRedisplayTimeout(5000); } Evergage.init().then(() => { // sitemap }); Please note: \u00b6 By design, Flicker Defender does not run in the Template or Campaign Editors.

Use this documentation as a guide for developing your own templates. Handlebars HTML \u00b6 HTML Syntax \u00b6 Indent nested elements 4 spaces (one press of the TAB key in the template editor). Break long lines to improve readability, up to 120 characters maximum per line. Place HTML attributes that extend beyond 120 characters on a new continuation line, indented 4 spaces. Use double quotes ( \"\" ) instead of single quotes ( '' ) for HTML attributes: <a class=\"evg-cta evg-btn evg-btn-primary evg-btn-lg\" href=\"/sale\"> The handlebars HTML content should all be contained within a single element. Write all code in lowercase, including HTML element names, attributes, and attribute values. Use HTML elements for their designed purpose. Whenever possible, use semantic elements that describe the meaning of the content. See section on \"Accessibility\" for more details. ID and Class Nomenclature \u00b6 Add an ID attribute to the outermost element, using a name specific to the template being built, and prefix with the evg- namespace (e.g. id=\u201cevg-hero-banner\u201d ). Use an ID for only this outermost HTML element and do not use the same ID in more than one template. Use classes for all other nested elements. Prefix classes with the evg- namespace (e.g. class=\u201cevg-btn\u201d ). Use hyphens to separate words in class and id names. <div id=\"evg-sale-banner\"> <h1 class=\"evg-header evg-h1\">One Day Sale!</h1> <a class=\"evg-cta evg-btn evg-btn-primary\" href=\"/sale\">SHOP</a> </div> Template HTML Classes \u00b6 For suggested evg- prefixed class names and descriptions of their intended purpose, as well as examples of CSS styling, refer to Template HTML Classes and CSS . Attributes Order \u00b6 List your HTML attributes in the following order to improve readability: class id , name data-* , data-evg-* src , for , type , href , value title , alt role , aria-* style Campaign Stats Tracking \u00b6 If you would like to track campaign stats with Interaction Studio, use the data attributes ( data-evg-* ) available in the Handlebars HTML. These data attributes require that the Campaign Stat Tracking gear is installed and enabled for your dataset. Example: <div id=\"evg-new-template\" data-evg-campaign-id=\"{{campaign}}\" data-evg-experience-id=\"{{experience}}\" data-evg-user-group=\"{{userGroup}}\"> ... </div> See the Campaign Stats article on this site to learn more. Accessibility \u00b6 Use HTML elements for their designed purpose. Whenever possible, use semantic elements to describe the meaning of the content to developers and the browser when appropriate. For example, use heading elements ( h1 , h2 , etc.) to identify headings, anchor elements ( a ) for navigation between pages, button elements ( button ) for actions like opening a modal, and input elements ( input ) for submit buttons (with the type=\"submit\" attribute). Semantic element examples: button , h1 , form , and header Non-semantic element examples: div and span If you do use non-semantic elements over semantic elements, add ARIA attributes to provide more meaning to the element. For example, if you use a div element instead of the h1 element as a level 1 heading and there is more than one heading on the page, add the role=\"heading\" and aria-level=\"<heading level number>\" ARIA attributes to the non-semantic element (e.g. <div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"1\">Page Heading</div> ). Doing so allows assistive technologies like screen readers to identify the non-semantic element as a heading. Provide an alt attribute for all image elements. In case an image fails to load, the text alternative can convey the meaning of the image in its place (e.g. alt=\"Woman with a shopping cart\" ). Aim for succinct, descriptive text. If the image is used purely for decoration and is not informative, set the alt tag to an empty string (e.g. alt=\"\" ) so that it can be ignored by assistive technologies. Do not leave out the alt attribute as some screen readers will resort to announcing the file name of the image. For close (\u2018X\u2019) buttons such as in popups, use a button element ( button ) with an aria-label attribute (e.g. aria-label=\"Close\" ) to provide an accessible name. The WAVE Evaluation Tool Chrome extension is useful for evaluating the accessibility of your site. For more information on accessibility, visit Web Content Accessibility Guidelines . Comments \u00b6 For comments you wish to keep in the Handlebars-generated HTML output, use the native HTML comment format: <!-- This comment will show up as a HTML comment --> <!-- This comment will also show up as a HTML comment --> For comments you wish to remove in the resulting HTML output, use the Handlebars HTML comment format shown below. {{! Single-line comments go here. This comment will not appear in the HTML output}} {{! Multi-line comments go here. This comment will not appear in the HTML output. }} Any Handlebars HTML comment that includes double curly braces or Handlebars expressions must follow the format below. These comments will also not appear in the resulting HTML output: {{!-- This comment can contain }}, {{, or {{ ... }} --}} {{!-- Multi-line comments go here. This comment will not appear in the HTML output. {{ handlebars expression }} --}} Visit the Handlebars documentation on template comments to learn more. CSS \u00b6 CSS Syntax \u00b6 Place the leading brace on the same line as the selector. /* bad */ #evg-banner .evg-cta { color: red; } /* good */ #evg-banner .evg-cta { color: red; } Add one space between the colon and value of each property. No space before the colon. /* bad */ #evg-banner .evg-cta { color:red; } /* bad */ #evg-banner .evg-cta { color :red; } /* good */ #evg-banner .evg-cta { color: red; } For each declaration, indent 4 spaces (one press of the TAB key in the template editor) and include a single space after the colon. End each declaration with a semicolon ( ; ). Add a blank line between rulesets. Add one space before the leading brace. /* bad */ #evg-banner .evg-cta{ color: red; } /* good */ #evg-banner .evg-cta { color: red; } Use the ID selector of the outermost element for every CSS rule to scope them all to the specific template. Use classes instead of element names as selectors that follow after the ID selector. #evg-exit-intent-popup .evg-overlay { position: fixed; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: #000; opacity: .3; } #evg-exit-intent-popup .evg-popup { position: fixed; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%); width: 500px; height: 500px; padding: 20px; background-color: #fff; background-position: center bottom; background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat; } When using multiple selectors for a ruleset, give each selector its own line. #evg-banner .evg-header, #evg-banner .evg-subheader { margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center; } Write code in lowercase, including selectors, properties, and property values (except for strings). /* bad */ #evg-banner .evg-message { color: #CED5DF; } /* good */ #evg-banner .evg-message { color: #ced5df; } Avoid using element names in conjunction with IDs or classes. Also avoid using ancestor selectors unless necessary. /* bad */ div#evg-banner { color: red; } /* good */ #evg-banner { color: red; } /* bad */ body div .evg-cta { color: red; } /* good */ .evg-cta { color: red; } Don't add units for \"0\" values, unless required. /* bad */ p { margin: 0px 10px; } /* good */ p { margin: 0 10px; } Don't add leading zeros in property values. /* bad */ p { font-size: 0.9rem; } /* good */ p { font-size: .9rem; } Accessibility \u00b6 Colors chosen for the text and background should satisfy the color contrast ratio as recommended by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Aim for a color contrast ratio of 4.5 or higher for normal text and 3 for larger text (18px in bold or 24px). Visit the WCAG documentation on minimum contrast to learn more. Use a tool like aremycolorsaccessible.com to check that the color ratio meets at least the AA level. When using a background image as the backdrop for text, set a fallback background color in case the image does not load. The fallback color should be chosen such that the text is still visible and the colors meet the color contrast ratio requirements. Example: #evg-hero-banner { background-image: url(\u2018image.png\u2019); background-color: green; } Declaration Order \u00b6 Group properties by type, in the following order: Positioning Display / Box Model Color Text Other Example: #evg-home-hero-banner .evg-btn { position: absolute; /* Positioning */ z-index: 10; /* Positioning */ top: 0; /* Positioning */ left: 0; /* Positioning */ display: inline-block; /* Display and Box Model */ box-sizing: border-box; /* Display and Box Model */ width: 100px; /* Display and Box Model */ margin-bottom: 10px; /* Display and Box Model */ padding: 10px 5px; /* Display and Box Model */ border-radius: 5px; /* Display and Box Model */ color: #fff; /* Color */ background-color: #215ca0; /* Color */ font-size: 16px; /* Text */ font-family: Arial, sans-serif; /* Text */ text-align: center; /* Text */ text-transform: uppercase; /* Text */ transition: color .15s; /* Other */ cursor: pointer; /* Other */ user-select: none; /* Other */ } Comments \u00b6 Use /* ... */ for comments. Single line: /* Comment goes here */ p { color: white; background-color: blue; } Multiline: /** * Comment * goes * here */ p { color: red; } Clientside JavaScript \u00b6 ES Version \u00b6 Global templates are written in ES6 syntax. Use ES5 syntax if there are plans to support IE browsers. Syntax \u00b6 Indent nested elements by 4 spaces (one press of the TAB key in the template editor). Break long lines to improve readability, up to 120 characters maximum per line (including whitespace). Add spaces between curly brackets and their contents. // bad const foo = {company: \u2018Salesforce\u2019} // good const foo = { company: \u2018Salesforce\u2019 } No spaces between square brackets and their contents. // bad const foo = [ a, b, c ]; // good const foo = [a, b, c]; No spaces between parentheses and their contents. // bad console.log( foo ) // good console.log(foo) // bad if ( bar ) { console.log(bar) } // good if (bar) { console.log(bar) } No space between the function name and opening parenthesis of the argument list. // bad function foo () { console.log(\"foo\"); } // good function foo() { console.log(\"foo\"); } Add one space before the leading brace. // bad function foo(){ console.log(\"foo\"); } // good function foo() { console.log(\"foo\"); } // bad if (foo){ console.log(foo); } // good if (foo) { console.log(foo); } Add one space before the opening parenthesis in conditional statements. // bad if(foo) { console.log(foo); } // good if (foo) { console.log(foo); } When chaining more than two methods, separate each method by a new line and use indentation. // bad Evergage.cashDom(\".evg-cta\").closest(\".evg-jumbotron\").find(\".evg-header\").text(\"Recommended For You\").css(\"text-align\", \"left\"); // good Evergage.cashDom(\".evg-cta\") .closest(\".evg-jumbotron\") .find(\".evg-header\") .text(\"Recommended For You\") .css(\"text-align\", \"left\"); DOM Manipulation \u00b6 Use Evergage.cashDom to select and manipulate elements from the DOM in a similar fashion to jQuery. Evergage.cashDom(selector: <string>, context) => Cash Visit the Cash documentation to learn more. Deferred Rendering \u00b6 Use Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded to defer the rendering of the template until the content zone element is loaded on page. To use this, you must have the Display Utilities gear installed and enabled for your dataset. The observer element that monitors for the content zone element to get inserted into its DOM node is set to \"body\" by default. For performance optimization, this default can be overridden by adding a second selector argument, which will be used as the observer element instead. return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(selector).then(function(element) { const html = template(context); Evergage.cashDom(element).html(html); applyTheme(context); }); Visit the Template Display Utilities documentation to learn more.

Whenever possible, use semantic elements to describe the meaning of the content to developers and the browser when appropriate. For example, use heading elements ( h1 , h2 , etc.) to identify headings, anchor elements ( a ) for navigation between pages, button elements ( button ) for actions like opening a modal, and input elements ( input ) for submit buttons (with the type=\"submit\" attribute). Semantic element examples: button , h1 , form , and header Non-semantic element examples: div and span If you do use non-semantic elements over semantic elements, add ARIA attributes to provide more meaning to the element. For example, if you use a div element instead of the h1 element as a level 1 heading and there is more than one heading on the page, add the role=\"heading\" and aria-level=\"<heading level number>\" ARIA attributes to the non-semantic element (e.g. <div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"1\">Page Heading</div> ). Doing so allows assistive technologies like screen readers to identify the non-semantic element as a heading. Provide an alt attribute for all image elements. In case an image fails to load, the text alternative can convey the meaning of the image in its place (e.g. alt=\"Woman with a shopping cart\" ). Aim for succinct, descriptive text. If the image is used purely for decoration and is not informative, set the alt tag to an empty string (e.g. alt=\"\" ) so that it can be ignored by assistive technologies. Do not leave out the alt attribute as some screen readers will resort to announcing the file name of the image. For close (\u2018X\u2019) buttons such as in popups, use a button element ( button ) with an aria-label attribute (e.g. aria-label=\"Close\" ) to provide an accessible name.

You'll be redirected to the same page with the query parameter evergageTestMessages=[CAMPAIGN_ID] in the URL. This will cause the campaign to act like it's published so you can test changes outside of the campaign editor. You will see whichever campaign experience your user account would qualify for.

This table stores the category IDs and names. In Interaction Studio, there is more than one way to represent a hierarchy. First, categories can be fully specified by the category ID itself (for example, \"womensapparel|denim|highrise\"). A hierarchy can be derived from the path. Second, you can use the parent_id field in the category. Products can belong to many categories. How you build categories will depend on your integration, but the data structure supports both approaches. Encoding the hierarchy in the ID is simpler. The parent ID can be used to handle the case when the hierarchy is sometimes not available but the short, non-hierarchical ID is consistently available in the various channels and systems that refer to the categories. Field Name Data Type Description Example values id Varchar(200) Unique identifier for the category name Varchar(200) Name of the category is_department Boolean True when the category is a department (a higher level entity in the category hierarchy) parent_id Varchar(200) Parent category ID of this category created_ts Timestamp without time zone Date and time the category was created in the operational store, UTC updated_ts Timestamp without time zone Date and time of the most recent update in the operation store, UTC (as of the recent DW import) Indexes: \u00b6 PRIMARY KEY category_pkey ON category USING btree (id) Referenced by: \u00b6 TABLE \"product_category\" CONSTRAINT \"product_category_category_id_fkey\" FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category(id) TABLE \"user_daily_stat_item_stat_category\" CONSTRAINT \"user_daily_stat_item_stat_category_category_id_fkey\" FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category(id) Example Query \u00b6 /* Get the number of products in each category */ SELECT c.name, count(1) AS num_products FROM product_category pc LEFT OUTER JOIN category c ON c.id = pc.category_id GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY count(1) DESC back to top Table country \u00b6 Country lookup table.

You can create different personalization results within the same campaign using experiences. For example, suppose you wish to create a campaign for first time visitors to your site, but you want to show a different message to visitors from Boston and San Francisco because you have events coming up in those two cities. You would create 3 experiences in the same campaign: one for visitors from Boston, one for visitors from San Francisco, and one for visitors from everywhere else. Then, you can use rules to restrict the visibility of these experiences to the target group of visitors.

This may or * may not be an authoritative entity, or the provider; if, for example, the AP generates the attribute value * through a derivation process, then the AP would be the origin. The key distinction between the origin and the * provider is the act of initially generating, capturing, or provisioning the attribute's value, rather than * just asserting the attribute's value to an RP. * * e.g. CRM, PointOfSaleSystem, FulfillmentSystem, or LoyaltySystem */ origin?: string; /** * The name of the entity that is providing the attribute. * * This specifies the name of the entity that supplies the attribute value to the RP.

Attribute collections are mutable - you can add, replace, and remove attributes. However, each attribute, once created, is immutable. This is to keep value and its optional associated metadata in sync - you must define them together.

Interaction Studio Developer versus Business User Tasks \u00b6 Interaction Studio can be configured to support customer engagement campaigns across many different digital communication channels (see Note ), including Web, Email, and Mobile, and through integrations with other systems such as CRM and other external data systems. Some of this configuration is done through the Interaction Studio UI, while other integration and configuration tasks require the development of code specific to the requirements of the company and its business users. For the purposes of this article and the remainder of the articles in this site, \"developer\" tasks refer to those tasks that require some kind of code development, while \"business user\" tasks refer to those which are done by users in the Interaction Studio UI. Note: For background and details on how businesses use channels and develop campaigns in the Interaction Studio UI, see Channels and Campaigns in the Interaction Studio Knowledge Base. Interaction Studio Developer Tasks \u00b6 The Interaction Studio system configuration tasks and the respective responsibilities of developers and business users include: Website integration: Web channel campaigns and the web templates that support them require integration with the company website. This integration is achieved through the Interaction Studio Web SDK and the Sitemap , a part of the Web SDK, that recognizes, processes and sends user interactivity data from the website to Interaction Studio. The individual or team responsible for managing scripts on the company website must deploy the Interaction Studio Web SDK to the designated company website pages. Then, a developer must validate the deployment and configure the Sitemap based on the data processing requirements provided by the business. The articles in the Web Integration section of this site provide website integration planning considerations, Interaction Studio Web SDK specifications, and Sitemap configuration requirements. Web template development: Before business users can develop web campaigns in the Interaction Studio UI, Interaction Studio developers must create the framework for displaying those web campaigns by developing reusable web templates. The Campaign Development section of this site explains the web campaign development process from the developer perspective and contains the articles explaining the technical requirements for web template development. Real-time event data API integration: Interaction Studio provides real-time data processing through its Event API . The Event API is a REST API that processes and responds to event data sent from the Sitemap or from external systems. The articles in the Event API section of this site cover the purpose, capabilities and requirements for using the Event API, HTTP request/response specifications, and HTTP request/response examples for common Interaction Studio use cases. Data ingestion system integration: Interaction Studio supports batch data ingestion and processing from external data system sources through ETL or other batch data processing technologies. The complete requirements for integrating external data systems for batch data ingestion into Interaction Studio are documented in this section of the Interaction Studio business user knowledge base. See Data Ingestion in this developer site for a brief overview. Mobile app integration: Interaction Studio can support campaigns for display on mobile devices by using responsive HTML (HTML5) in its normal web templates feature or through integration with native iOS and Android mobile apps. See Interaction Studio Mobile Integrations for an introduction to the capabilities of the Interaction Studio iOS and Android mobile app integrations and links to the separate native mobile app developer documentation websites.","title":"Developer Role and Responsibilities"},{"location":"develop-overview/developer-role-responsibilities/#interaction-studio-developer-versus-business-user-tasks","text":"Interaction Studio can be configured to support customer engagement campaigns across many different digital communication channels (see Note ), including Web, Email, and Mobile, and through integrations with other systems such as CRM and other external data systems.

For example, you can create a rule that will filter out promotions in a Contextual Bandit campaign based on whether a user has an attribute that matches the eligible promotion's dimension. These filtering rules can be checked when applied to any campaign, bandit arm, or segment. If a rule is not applicable for a particular environment, the filter won't apply. Methods and Implementation \u00b6 Generic - What is the type of data that the Gear component is using to identify whether this filter should apply? Examples include, string if trying to determine a particular dimension's value or number if the rule is based on a user's LTV.

Additionally, the information in this document may prove helpful to reference throughout each phase of an implementation. As a final validation for working on a sitemap, we suggest working through the following steps. The checklists laid out in this document are by no means comprehensive. Instead, they are meant to call out common areas where implementors run into trouble while writing sitemap code. Article Topics \u00b6 This article covers the following topics: * Validate the Javascript * Use the browser extension to test the sitemap code * Evergage.sendEvent usage * Single Page App (SPA) sites * Timing issues * Data Capture Sources Validate the Javascript \u00b6 Checklist: \u00b6 Check for common Javascript errors by reviewing the sitemap code in the sitemap code editor, found in the Interaction Studio Visual Editor, as it identifies and highlights errors in your code. You can also validate your code by visually spot-checking it for errors. We suggest utilizing Evergage.cashDom for each implementation instead of using jQuery or some other library that the IS platform does not include (such as Knockout). Since the Interaction Studio Beacon includes CashDom (the cash library), code written using CashDom remains unaffected by updates made to JS libraries found on the client site, thereby allowing for greater stability over time. The sitemap should not be manipulating the DOM in any way; that is the function of the Campaigns and Templates system. For more information on using these features on your Web integration, refer to the Web Campaigns and Templates documentation . Resolvers should not be used in situations where a direct value needs to be ingested, like when assigning a value to a variable, resolvers are designed to return a function. For example, this is not a proper use of a resolver: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelector(\".someCssSelector\")() . Use the browser extension to test the sitemap code \u00b6 Injecting or forcing the SDK URL to test the sitemap code. Install and Use the Evergage Launcher If you followed the best practices in the Plan a Web Integration document, you can validate your sitemap code against a test dataset that is available. Once your test dataset is running on the site, click through the mapped pages and check to see that the events are sending as expected. Check out our documentation on Event Validation Using Chrome Browser Developer Tools . Checklist: \u00b6 No errors in network tab for each event Mapped attributes are appearing as expected in the events Ensure that the Sitemap Implementation and any Event API Request objects in your code are structured properly and are collecting values of the correct type for each option according to our documentation. When collecting Category data associated with another item type ( Article , Product or Blog ), remember that that the structure and case of category ids should be consistent on all catalog items mapped with categories. Category ID structure should be carefully validated. When mapping the Category item type directly, the value of _id in the pageType should always be supplied as a string. Additionally, a hierarchy of Categories can be constructed by using | separated values to denote each level of the Category hierarchy. Ideally, these values will be normalized in some way with your sitemap as they are collected. Normalizing these values helps ensure consistency within your catalog. For example, the Interaction Studio platform considers a Category with an ID of \"Green Hats\" different than a Category with an ID of \"Green hats\". In the following example Category ID, all of the principles and best practices concerning Category ID structure have been utilized: main-category|sub-cat-1|sub-cat-2 . Check whether listeners are binding correctly on each page and are successfully sending events without errors or incorrectly formatted data, as described above. For example, if a sitemap has a click listener that listens for a click on a button to send an add to cart event, ensure that clicking that button sends an add to cart event with all of the appropriate lineItem data successfully. Validate that onActionEvent is being used correctly. While it is possible to do so, we strongly discourage the use of event listeners and/or the use of Evergage.sendEvent in onActionEvent . However, if you do decide that you must use Evergage.sendEvent here, take extra care to make sure that your code includes an exit case since you will otherwise risk the possibility of triggering an infinite loop. Ensure that onActionEvent is not being used to overwrite the contents of the event, rather only to manipulate it and/or append additional data. Additionally, onActionEvent should always return the ActionEvent, even if no transformations and/or modifications are made. Examples of properly using onActionEvent to ingest user attributes can be found in the Capturing User and Account Attributes page. Validate that your code is using supported and correctly formatted fields when mapping Page Types. The supported fields are outlined in the Page Types documentation. Ensure that your mapped content zones are capable of supporting the customer's use-cases. Refer to the Content Zones documentation which outlines many commonly mapped content zones to get some ideas. Evergage.sendEvent usage \u00b6 This function is used to send an Event to Interaction Studio. Events sent using this function should directly follow the structure of the Event API requests, as outlined in the Event API documentation. Please note that, while very similar, the Event API and page types in the sitemap do have different structures. Single Page App (SPA) sites \u00b6 For more information about handling SPA page changes, refer to the Single Page App (SPA) Handling documentation . While the documented example on that page is powered by the use of an interval, you can use a different mechanism to monitor the site for page changes at your own discretion. Timing issues \u00b6 Do selectors work in the console or editor, but the sitemap is still unsuccessful in scraping those values when actually sending the event? The location of the data you are scraping probably does not exist at the time the page matches. Solution: Write a Promise for the isMatch function that matches the page type which relies on data not available precisely at page load. The page will be matched when the Promise resolves, that resolution being delayed until the source of your data exists in the DOM or window object. Data Capture Sources \u00b6 When deciding on what to capture, first consider all possible locations where the data is available on the page for that pageType . While testing a new source of data, ensure the method of obtaining the data persists throughout the Page Type and that the data is available when the sitemap executes. For synchronous integrations, this may mean using a Promise to resolve the isMatch function when data is available or using Promises for the catalog _id field until the available data is available to capture. 1. Window Objects \u00b6 Data found within window objects (i.e. window.dataLayer ) tends to be more static and reliable, though be careful about using third-party vendor. Sites correctly implemented with Shopify, Magento, and Drupal tend to be more reliable than others. Taken from the NTO example , we are able to extract the product details found inside the eCommerce data object in the following example: const getProductsFromDataLayer = () => { if (window.dataLayer) { for (let i = 0; i < window.dataLayer.length; i++) { if ((window.dataLayer[i].ecommerce && window.dataLayer[i].ecommerce.detail || {}).products) { return window.dataLayer[i].ecommerce.detail.products; } } } }; The Evergage.resolver.fromWindow and Evergage.util.getValueFromNestedObject functions can be used to safely return a value from a nested object. For example if capturing data from window.dataLayer[0].ecommerce.detail.products , if one part of the path is not defined will cause an error. The Evergage.resolver.fromWindow function safely navigates the path given to return a value if it exists or null if the nested object, or some object in the path, does not exist. 2. Meta Tags \u00b6 If the data exists within the meta tag and the DOM, Metatag data is a reliable data format. Interaction Studio has a built-in resolver function to retrieve data from meta tags: Evergage.resolvers.fromMeta(). As an example, say a hypothetical website selling widgets contains the following meta tag for description: <meta name=\"description\" content=\"The premier place for all your widget needs.\"> In a catalog config, you can retrieve the description content of that tag with the following code: description: Evergage.resolvers.fromMeta(\"description\"); description will now have the string value: The premier place for all your widget needs. 3. itemprop \u00b6 The itemprop attribute is used to add properties to an element on the page, describing the content in the element. Learn more about the itemprop attribute here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop Interaction Studio has a built-in resolver function to retrieve data from elements with a specified itemprop: Evergage.resolvers.fromItemProp This resolver function will return the content of the first matching element with the given item prop. For example, when trying to capture the rating on a product you may see that a page contains the following element: <meta itemprop='ratingValue' content='5'> In a catalog config, you can retrive the rating value of that element with the following code: rating: Evergage.resolvers.fromItemProp('ratingValue') rating will now have the value \"5\" 4. JSON-LD \u00b6 JSON-LD is popular way to annotate and describe elements on a page with structured data. Interaction Studio has a built-in resolver function to parse and retrieve data from a JSON-LD element: Evergage.resolvers.fromJsonLd . This resolver function will parse the first JSON-LD script on the page. If given a path , it will return the value of the path from the parsed JSON-LD object. For example if a site had the following element: <script type=\"application/ld+json\"> {\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Product\",\"name\":\"Worlds Greatest Widget\",\"description\":\"The premier place for all your widget needs.\",\"id\":\"123\",\"brand\":{\"@type\":\"Thing\",\"name\":\"Widget\"},\"availability\":\"http://schema.org/InStock\"} </script> In the catalog config, you can retrieve the entire object using Evergage.resolvers.fromJsonLd() , or if you only wanted a single element such as name , Evergage.resolvers.fromJsonLd('name') . 5. URLs \u00b6 A pages URL can contain helpful information that you may want to capture. For example, a Product URL can be captured directily from the URL that the user is on using the Evergage.resolvers.fromHref resolver function. Some pages may also contain a canonical link element which is the preferred URL of the page. Canonical URLs can be captured using the Evergage.resolvers.fromCanonical resolver function. 6. Page Source Code \u00b6 Sometimes the only source of data is the DOM itself. Interaction Studio has several helper functions that can extract the data you need. The Evergage.resolver.fromSelector , Evergage.resolver.fromSelectorMultiple , Evergage.resolver.fromSelectorAttribute and Evergage.resolver.fromSelectorAttributeMultiple resolver functions provide for utilities to extract text and attributes from elements in the DOM. For example if a site had the following element: <span id=\"product\" data-productId=\"123\">Worlds Greatest Widget</span> In the catalog config, you could retrieve the product Id with the following code: _id: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttribute('#product', 'data-productId') and you could retrieve the product's name with the following: name: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelector('#product') For those familiar with cash , Evergage.cashDom can also be used to retrieve data on the DOM. You can view the list of available utility functions in Evergage.js in the source menu inside the dev tool. 7. Evergage.DisplayUtils \u00b6 When you do have to use a Promsie to wait for data to be available, the Evergage.DisplayUtil functions provide methods which are helpful in waiting for specific elements to be on the page. The Evergage.DisplayUtil.pageElementLoaded triggers only when the specified element is loaded on the page. For example, if you need to wait for the #productId element to be on the page in order to capture the _id of a product, you can use the following: _id: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtil.pageElementLoaded(\"#productId\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelector(\"#productId\"); }); } 8. Evergage.util.resolveWhenTrue \u00b6 When you have to to wait for data to be available on the page, Evergage.util.resolveWhenTrue provides a set of utility functions to bind and unbind checks that returns a promise that resolves when the provided check returns a truthy value. The Evergage.util.resolveWhenTrue.bind function also provides a timeout that will reject if the provided function does not resolve in the specified time. For example, if you need to wait for window.dataLayer[0].productId to be available on the page to capture the product _id, you could use the following: _id: () => { return Evergage.util.resolveWhenTrue.bind(() => { let productId = Evergage.util.getValueFromNestedObject(\"window.dataLayer[0].productId\"); if (productId) { return productId; } else { return false; } }, 1000, 50); } 9. Additional Best Practices \u00b6 Avoid Undefined Data: If your data field is dependent on a resolver, include it as a return inside a function to avoid having undefined data being sent. Practice Console Logging: Get into a good habit of console logging the data in the sitemap. Just because it was available in Chrome Developer Tools doesn\u2019t mean it will be available at the precise moment that IS sitemap code is executing. Consider the timing when the data is available. Does it load only after a certain action? Is it only available when the user is logged in? Console Logging should only be used when developing a sitemap. You should avoid including these statements in a live sitemap. Test your data source thoroughly: Navigate to the page from a different link Click back and forth on the browser button to ensure the data persists through the change. Some pages may display differently depending on the referring source. This is especially true for single page applications. Consider backup plans: If the data is available in two separate areas, consider using the second source of data as a backup. When creating custom helper functions, always assume the value is not available and null check everything. Ensure clean data capture: Trim the values, especially when it comes to IDs. Errant empty spaces can produce duplicate items in the catalog. Evergage.resolver functions will automatically trim values for you. Keep your data capture as simple as possible: When using selectors, prefer IDs and unique classes over relative selectors if possible. Long chains of child selectors or selectors using nth-child may not always return the same element on pages of the same type. When using selectors on the DOM, try to reduce the number of selectors down to the minimum required to obtain the data. If the selector is too specific, it may not capture the data the same way on other Page Types. Double check data capture from Meta Tags: Be careful of Meta tags, some sites do not always update the Meta tags appropriately.","title":"Best Practices for Data Capture Using Site Mapping"},{"location":"web-integ/best-practices-data-capture/#article-topics","text":"This article covers the following topics: * Validate the Javascript * Use the browser extension to test the sitemap code * Evergage.sendEvent usage * Single Page App (SPA) sites * Timing issues * Data Capture Sources","title":"Article Topics"},{"location":"web-integ/best-practices-data-capture/#validate-the-javascript","text":"","title":"Validate the Javascript"},{"location":"web-integ/best-practices-data-capture/#checklist","text":"Check for common Javascript errors by reviewing the sitemap code in the sitemap code editor, found in the Interaction Studio Visual Editor, as it identifies and highlights errors in your code.

Item actions are a separate event property from regular actions ( action ). Item actions contain reserved action names used by Interaction Studio to determine how to treat event data. Interaction Studio will automatically insert the appropriate value for this property when sending events containing catalog data originating from matching a pageType mapped in the Sitemap code. This means that the itemAction property should not be manually mapped in your global or pageType configurations with two notable exceptions. When mapping pages with cart or order , the itemAction will have to be specified in your pageType configuration. Typically the cart object is mapped only on the cart page itself with the itemAction value of, \"View Cart\" ( Evergage.ItemAction.ViewCart ). Similarly, order is usually only mapped on the order confirmation page with the itemAction value of \"Purchase\" ( Evergage.ItemAction.Purchase ). Item Actions in the Event API \u00b6 The item action property value will only need to be manually set when sending events to the Interaction Studio platform using the event API. Only the reserved item action values within Evergage.ItemAction can be used. Within the context of the Sitemap, the event API is used to send an event independantly of the page matching event. This is achieved using Evergage.sendEvent() . An example of an event sent using the API within the Sitemap can be found in our Example Ecommerce Sitemap within the \"product_detail\" pageType configuration. The relevant code block has been included below. In this example, a listener has been mapped containing an add to cart event that will fire when the user clicks on the DOM element referenced by the provided selector, \".add-to-cart\" . listeners: [ Evergage.listener(\"click\", \".add-to-cart\", () => { const lineItem = Evergage.util.buildLineItemFromPageState(\"select[id*=quantity]\"); lineItem.sku = { _id: Evergage.cashDom(\".product-detail[data-pid]\").attr(\"data-pid\")}; Evergage.sendEvent({ itemAction: Evergage.ItemAction.AddToCart, cart: { singleLine: { Product: lineItem } } }); }), ], Reserved Item Action Values \u00b6 The possible values for item action are all contained within the Evergage.ItemAction object. All values assigned to the itemAction property should be referenced from the Evergage.ItemAction object in the same way as the add to cart event detailed in the previous section. The possible values for item action are all contained within the Evergage.ItemAction object, which is detailed in our typeDoc here .

Special Item Actions \u00b6 Quick View Item - Similar to View Item but stops the timer for the \"background\" item and starts a timer for the \"foreground\" item. Stop Quick View Item - Stops the timer initiated by the \"Quick View Item\" item action for the \"foreground\" item and restarts the timer for the \"background\" item. Quick View Item and Stop Quick View Item are used to accurately track view time in cases where a user \"views\" an item while already viewing a different item. An e-commerce category page that allows users to view individual products in a popup modal might take advantage of these item actions. In this example, the \"background\" item is the category and the \"foreground\" item is the product. A new page load will stop both timers.

Customers typically sign up for a single account for their license, and can have multiple datasets associated with each account \u2014 similar to Marketing Cloud business units. Each dataset in IS is a separate, siloed data environment. Data is not shared between datasets, so the same user could have an independent profile in each dataset. Campaigns, segments, statistics, and integrations are also not shared between datasets. IS customers can also set permissions levels for their teams, ensuring that each team has access to the datasets they need to use Interaction Studio for their business needs. It is common to have a single dataset associated with one web domain. However, it is possible to have more than one domain on an Interaction Studio license, or have a domain that serves multiple countries in multiple languages. In these cases, dataset design during the discovery process is an important step in a successful Interaction Studio implementation. What factors influence dataset design? \u00b6 How many web domains are included in the license? Are they all the same brand, or are they different brands? How many countries (or locales) does the domain(s) support? Multiple Domains \u00b6 If there are multiple domains on one Interaction Studio license, either each domain should have a separate dataset or the domains could be combined into a single dataset. Often, it is best to have a single dataset per domain, but there are often good reasons to combine multiple domains into a single dataset. See below for guidance on using a single dataset for multiple domains. Designing the Catalog \u00b6 Depending on the catalog differences between the different sites, there are some things to keep in mind when designing how the catalog data model will look. If the sites do share products with the same IDs, you may want to differentiate between these products by making the IDs unique per site. This could be done by prefixing the IDs that would be captured by a unique identifier for the site. For example consider two sites, websitea.example and websiteb.example . These two sites share a product with the ID abc123 When importing and capturing catalog data you may want to prefix this product ID based on site to differentiate the product in the Interaction Studio Catalog since it could have different attributes depending on the site. On websitea.example the ID could become websitea_abc123 and on websiteb.example the ID could become websiteb_abc123 . To help differentiate products that exists on different sites in the same dataset, it is a good idea to track a dimension for the site the product appears on. This dimension would allow for differentiating products available only on the site the user is currently on in recipes. Consider the two sites websitea.example and websiteb.example . When viewing a product on websitea.example you could set this dimension to websitea.example and when viewing a product on websiteb.example you could set this dimension to websiteb.example . Having this dimension available would allow adding a recipe exclusion to any recommendations so that only products available on the site the user is currently on would be recommended. Sitemap \u00b6 When mapping multiple sites to the same dataset, these sites will share the same Web SDK and same Sitemap integration. Setting the Cookie Domain \u00b6 By default, the cookieDomain set when initializing the Web SDK for tracking will be the current domain. If you need to configure the cookieDomain setting, you would need to dynamically determine which domain the cookie should be set on since the initialization would be shared between the different sites. This example shows how to dynamically determine and set a custom cookieDomain based on the site that the Web SDK is initializing for. The Interaction Studio Web SDK anonymous user IDs are generated separately for each domain. When integrating multiple domains in the same dataset, users that are tracked anonymously will be tracked as separate users across the different domains. const getCookieDomain = () => { let currentDomain = window.location.hostname; if (currentDomain === \"websitea.example\") { return \"websitea.example\"; } else if (currentDomain === \"websiteb.example\") { return \"websiteb.example\"; } } const currentCookieDomain = getCookieDomain(); Evergage.init({ cookieDomain: currentCookieDomain }) Initializing the Correct Sitemap \u00b6 When mapping multiple domains to the same dataset you will want to have separate Sitemap configs for each domain. This allows for configuring unique Page Types for each site. Once you have built the Sitemap configs for each domain, you will need to initialize the correct Sitemap config based on which domain the user is currently visiting. See the following example: const getCookieDomain = () => { let currentDomain = window.location.hostname; if (currentDomain === \"websitea.example\") { return \"websitea.example\"; } else if (currentDomain === \"websiteb.example\") { return \"websiteb.example\"; } } const currentCookieDomain = getCookieDomain(); Evergage.init({ cookieDomain: currentCookieDomain }).then(() => { let siteAConfig = { global: {}, pageTypeDefault: { name: \"default\" }, pageTypes: [ { name: \"home\", action: \"Example A Home\", isMatch: () => window.location.pathname === \"/\" } ] }; let siteBConfig = { global: {}, pageTypeDefault: { name: \"default\", }, pageTypes: [ { name: \"home\", action: \"Example B Home\", isMatch: () => window.location.pathname === \"/\" } ] }; if (currentCookieDomain === \"websitea.example\") { Evergage.initSitemap(siteAConfig); } else if (currentCookieDomain === \"websiteb.example\") { Evergage.initSitemap(siteBConfig); } }) Page Types and Content Zones \u00b6 Make sure that the pageType names are consistent between the domains. A product detail page on websitea.example and a product detail page on websiteb.example would both share the same product_detail page type. Actions and catalog items can differentiate which site the user is currently visiting. While Content Zone selectors may be different between two different domains, Content Zone names should be consistent across domains. This will help facilitate the sharing of templates and campaigns.","title":"Multisite Implementation Strategy"},{"location":"web-integ/multisite-strategy/#what-factors-influence-dataset-design","text":"How many web domains are included in the license?

While the Web SDK portion alone will be the same for every integration, Beacon Extensions and Sitemap can be different and may have their own special considerations regarding site impact. Integration \u00b6 Downloading and executing Interaction Studio\u2019s JavaScript will inherently impact a site\u2019s performance just by being a new piece of content to load. We minimize the impact by: Serving via a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) with over 40 points of presence around the globe. Utilizing our CDNs option to serve stale, such that even if the SDKs origin server is unavailable or slow, we will continue to serve a cached version of the SDK. Client-side caching, to ensure only the first page load requires downloading of the file. Keeping the Web SDK small, under 50 KBs compressed with gzip, before optional Beacon Extensions and the Sitemap. While the above points apply to all Web SDK integrations, there are two methods for integrating Interaction Studio into a website: Synchronous and Asynchronous, each with different levels of impact on the site. Synchronous \u00b6 With a synchronous integration, the Interaction Studio\u2019s JavaScript will download at the point it is present in the page before the browser continues to execute the rest of the page. In doing so, the Flicker Defender Beacon Extension will be able to prevent content that may be personalized from appearing before it can be personalized and tracking can take place as soon as possible. Asynchronous \u00b6 With an asynchronous integration, Interaction Studio\u2019s JavaScript will download alongside the rest of the page\u2019s content loading. Flicker Defender does not function in asynchronous integrations. Integration Failures \u00b6 Interaction Studio is configured to use multiple industry standard CDN providers, and in the unlikely scenario that one of them has an outage we can quickly reconfigure Interaction Studio to use another provider. Uptime statistics can be found here. In the case that Interaction Studio\u2019s CDN was unavailable the request to load the SDK will fail or timeout and no personalization will take place. If the site is integrated synchronously, the page will delay loading until the failure. Execution \u00b6 After the JavaScript is downloaded, it is executed in the order of content (Web SDK, Beacon Extensions, Sitemap). We target that the Web SDK\u2019s JavaScript, as well as calls to initialize the Web SDK via the Sitemap, execute in under 30 milliseconds. Execution Failures \u00b6 Script failures inside of the Web SDK, Beacon Extensions, and Sitemap are caught and logged, to prevent the scripts from negatively impacting the site\u2019s core functionality. Errors can be tracked within Interaction Studio\u2019s event stream to help identify resolutions in cases where the Sitemap errors prevent personalization. Event Requests \u00b6 After execution, an event will be sent to Interaction Studio\u2019s Event API and its response will contain any campaigns for personalization. Interaction Studio targets 20ms for all server-side execution. End user response time is subject to the performance of the internet connection. Request Failures \u00b6 These requests have no impact on the page loading, and failures will not be noticed by end users. If Flicker Defender is active, hidden content will redisplay after the configured timeout, with a default of 2.5 seconds from the time the beacon extension first ran. Uptime can be monitored here.","title":"Interaction Studio Site Impact Approach"},{"location":"web-integ/site-impact-approach/#overview","text":"The Interaction Studio Web SDK runs on web pages to both gather relevant information and modify content to provide a personalized experience to the web page\u2019s visitors.

There are several ways to validate whether the Sitemap configuration is properly recognizing the targeted user actions and sending the corresponding events. Sitemap Events \u00b6 Sitemap events are HTTP requests sent to Interaction Studio's Event API endpoint that describe the context of the page or a specific action a user performed on the site. Some examples include: Visiting a page Viewing a catalog item Submitting a form Adding an item to a shopping cart Purchasing an item Clicking a designated page area Sitemap Event Validation Tools and Methods \u00b6 The tools and methods Sitemap developers can use to validate Sitemap events include: Interaction Studio Sitemap Editor Interaction Studio Event Stream Report Chrome Browser Developer Tools The remainder of this article provides guidance for using each of these tools to validate a Sitemap. Event Validation Using the Sitemap Editor \u00b6 As you develop a Sitemap, you can use the Sitemap Editor as described in the following sections to confirm that the JavaScript describing your events is valid and configured properly. Sitemap JS Tab Code Check \u00b6 The Sitemap JS tab where you enter your Sitemap JavaScript has a built-in code validator that will flag the presence of JavaScript syntax errors as highlighted in the following figure. The Logs tab provides messages related to the JavaScript code errors flagged by the Sitemap JS code editor. However, you may want to use a more robust JavaScript validation tool to investigate JavaScript syntax issues and code execution errors flagged in the Sitemap JS code editor. Current Page Object Validation \u00b6 The Current Page tab of the Sitemap Editor is shown below: The Current Page tab will display all Sitemap objects configured and executed on the current page shown in the browser, including: Page Type: Name of the configured page type of the currently displayed page User Data: ID of the current user browsing the page and any user-triggered events that are configured on the page. The user ID can be the user ID that is randomly generated for anonymous site visitors or a named user ID. Catalog Data: Names of Catalog objects configured on the current page. Content Zones: Names of Content Zone objects configured on the current page. DOM Listeners: Names of JavaScript DOM listeners configured on the current page. Current Page Object Examples \u00b6 The following figure shows an example of how Sitemap objects display in the Current Page tab with key functional areas indicated by numbers. The following sections describe the purpose and function of each area and are numbered corresponding to the numbers on the figure. 1. Current Page (Site Home Page) \u00b6 This area displays the current page of the target site that the Sitemap editor is targeting. The objects displayed in the Current Page tab will be the objects configured for the page type displayed here. In the above example, the browser used by the Sitemap editor is on the Home page of the target site, and has a pageTypes object called \"home\" configured in the Sitemap ( 9 ). 2. Execute (button) \u00b6 Clicking the Execute button runs and validates the JavaScript entered in the Sitemap JS editor. Sitemap objects that resolve with the current page type or global configuration will display in the Current Page tab. Objects with invalid JavaScript will not display in the Current Page tab. 3. Page Type \u00b6 This area displays the page type that matches the results of the isMatch function configured for the currently displayed page type. In the above example, the site Home page type ( 1 ) is matched by the isMatch function configured for the page type named home in the Sitemap ( 9 ). 4. User Data \u00b6 This area displays the user ID of the user visiting the current page as well as any user-triggered events configured in the Sitemap. The above example shows an anonymous user ID. 5. Catalog Data \u00b6 This area displays any catalog objects configured in the Sitemap JS for the currently displayed page. In the above Home page example, no catalog objects have been configured. 6. Content Zones - Global \u00b6 The above example shows that this Sitemap has two global Content Zones that are properly configured to display in the Current Page tab. Global content zones will be active in all configured page types. 7. DOM Listeners \u00b6 The above example shows that this Sitemap has a listener in the global configuration that that is properly configured to display in the DOM Listeners section of the Current Page tab. This listener will send an event to Interaction Studio when a user signs up for an email subscription. 8. Content Zones - Page Type \u00b6 The above example shows that this Sitemap has three Content Zones that are properly configured to display in the Current Page tab when the Sitemap editor is on the home page type. 9. pageTypes: \"home\" \u00b6 The above example shows that this Sitemap has a \"home\" page type configured to display in the Page Type section of the Current Page tab ( 3 ) when the Sitemap editor is on the home page type. Page Match Validation \u00b6 The Page Matches tab displays the currently matched page type as well as all other page types configured in the Sitemap. The currently matched page displays with a \"checkmark\" icon, while the other configured page types display with a \"backslash\" icon to indicate they were not matched as the current page. The following figure shows an example of the Page Matches tab where the home page is the currently matched page as well as several other pages that are configured in the Sitemap JS editor but are not matched as the current page. Event Validation Using the Event Stream Report \u00b6 The Interaction Studio Event Stream report displays all events received by Interaction Studio, including events sent from the Sitemap as well as from other sources. Accessing the Event Stream Report \u00b6 To access the Event Stream report, do the following: 1. Login to Interaction Studio. ![Interaction Studio Login](salesforce-interaction-studio-login.png) In the Dashboard , use the dataset pull-down menu select the dataset that contains the events you want to see. Hover over Reports on the left menu to display the reports popup menu, and select Event Stream from the Activity section of the menu. Example: Event Processing and Display in the Event Stream \u00b6 The Sitemap JavaScript is configured to send events to Interaction Studio based on the actions by site visitors. This section presents an example based of an anonymous user who decides to sign up for emails from the company (thus becoming \"known\"), and then chooses to browse the Men's section of the website. JavaScript Listener for Email Sign-Up \u00b6 The following shows an example of a JavaScript listener configured to send an event when a user signs up for email. The sign-up form appears on the bottom of every page in the site so this listener should be configured as part of the global configuration. listeners: [ Evergage.listener(\"submit\", \".email-signup\", () => { const email = Evergage.cashDom(\"#dwfrm_mcsubscribe_email\").val(); if (email) { Evergage.sendEvent({action: \"Email Sign Up - Footer\", user: {id: email} }); } }), ] Site UI for Email Sign-Up \u00b6 The following shows an example of a site email sign-up form being completed by \"Joe Customer\". With the JavaScript listener configured as shown in the preceding section, an event will be sent to Interaction Studio and show up in the Event Stream when a user provides their email address and clicks the submit button ( -> ). Events Displayed in the Event Stream Report \u00b6 If the email signup listener is properly configured in the Sitemap, when \"Joe Customer\" provides his email and clicks Submit , the event will show up immediately in the Interaction Studio Event Stream report. This report provides the following information and functionality: Event stream search Event stream table Event details for individual events The following figure shows an example of the events sent to Interaction Studio before and after Joe Customer submitted his email in the email sign-up form. The following sections describe the information and functionality provided by the Event Stream report. Note: See Understanding the Event Stream for more information on the available functionality in the Event Stream report. Event Stream Search \u00b6 In the Event Stream search area, you can search for and filter the Event Stream table to display only events that were generated by a specific UserID/User Name or email address. This is done as follows: In the keyword field, enter text that matches characters in the user name or email address for the user whose events you want to see. As soon as you enter characters that match an existing user name or email address, the matching user name(s) will display. Click the desired user. The Event Stream table will now display only the events for that user. If you want to see only events of a specific type, click the Event Type pull-down menu and select the desired type. Event Stream Table \u00b6 The Event Stream table lists event data for all events triggered by the Sitemap and other event sources from other systems in the Interaction Studio integration. The data in the Event Stream table is refreshed every 15 seconds and includes: * Timestamp: Time or date that the event occurred. Events triggered on the current day will have a timestamp of how many minutes/hours ago the event was triggered. Events triggered the day before the current day will have a timestamp of \"yesterday\". Earlier events will have a timestamp of the date the event was triggered. * User Name or Email: User name or email address of the user who triggered the event. * Action or URL: Name of the action for which the event was triggered or the URL of the page which the user visited that triggered the event. Modifying the Event Stream Data View The Event Stream table provides the following functionality to modify how the data in the table displays: * Click a column heading in the Event Stream table to sort the table by the data in that field. * Click the same column heading more than once to toggle between an ascending/descending data sort. * Click an individual event entry in the table to display the details for that event as described in the following section. From Anonymous to Known User \u00b6 The example shown in the following figure shows what happens after \"Joe Customer\" submits his email address. The anonymous user 7ddc1195... changes to the known user joe.customer@email.com . This happens any time an anonymous user identifies themselves through an action like email submission or log in. Interaction Studio associates the anonymous ID with the known user and adds the browsing behavior of the anonymous ID to the Unified Customer Profile of the known user. A known user may have many associated anonymous IDs (and more than one known user name) depending on their browsing habits on the site. Note: The figure above is presented for example only. In large environments with hundreds or thousands of simultaneous visitors you will not be able to visually associate the anonymous user ID with their known user name. Individual Event Details \u00b6 When you click an individual event in the Event Stream table, the details for that event will display in the Event Detail area to the right of the Event Stream table. As shown in the above figure, the details provided in the Event Detail area for the selected individual event include: Timestamp: Date and time that the event was triggered. User ID: User name, email address, or anonymous user ID of the user who triggered the event. URL: Page on which the user generated the event. Client IP: IP address of the user client that generated the event. User Agent: User Agent (UA) string sent in the HTTP header with browser requests that typically identifies the browser type, browser version, and browser host operating system. Beacon Version: Version of the JavaScript Beacon that sent the event. contentZones: Content Zone in the Sitemap on which the event was generated. The above figure shows an event that was triggered when a user clicked in a Sitemap Content Zone called global_infobar_top_of_page . pageType: The type of page that the user accessed. The above figure shows the event of a user accessing the \"Men's\" category page of a retailer. This page has no configured page type in the Sitemap, so the pageType value is default . channel: The engagement channel that generated the event. For Sitemap-generated events, the channel will always be Web . .scv: The Sitemap Configuration Version (SCV) is incremented every time changes to the Sitemap are saved. This value is used internally by Interaction Studio to prevent conflicts with events sent from earlier Sitemap versions. Event Validation Using Chrome Browser Developer Tools \u00b6 Sitemap developers can also validate Sitemap events using the Google Chrome browser's built-in developer tools as described in the following sections. Viewing Page Load Events \u00b6 The simplest way to view events that are triggered by page load is to run the Evergage.getCurrentPage command from the Chrome Console developer panel. However, this command will not display events that are triggered after page load. To run this command, do the following: Close out of the Interaction Studio Sitemap Editor. Browse to the site page containing the events you want to validate. Open the Chrome Developer Tools and navigate to the Console panel. Run the following command: Evergage.getCurrentPage() The following figure shows an example of the results of running the Evergage.getCurrentPage command. Validating Individual Event Configurations \u00b6 In the Chrome Network developer panel, you can see all events generated on the current page, including those generated after page load. This can be done as follows: Close out of the Interaction Studio Sitemap Editor. Browse to the site page containing the events you want to validate. Take an action on the page that you expect to generate an event. Open the Chrome Developer Tools and navigate to the Network panel. Find and select the event. The event will have the name of your dataset followed by a question mark (?) and the word \"event\". Select the event and select the Headers panel to view the event. Events are sent from the Sitemap to Interaction Studio as JSON GET requests. The events are converted to Base 64 and appended to the request URL as shown in the following figure. Copy the event GET request starting immediately after the event= to the end as highlighted in the figure below. Navigate to the Chrome Console developer tool. Run the atob command to convert the event back to JavaScript objects. You can run the JSON.parse command in combination with the atob command to return the event JavaScript formatted. The syntax for running this command is as follows: JSON.parse(atob(\"<Event text in Base 64>\")) The following figure shows an example of this command and the results returned. Review the event and confirm it contains the expected objects.","title":"Sitemap Event Validation"},{"location":"web-integ/site-map-event-validation/#sitemap-events","text":"Sitemap events are HTTP requests sent to Interaction Studio's Event API endpoint that describe the context of the page or a specific action a user performed on the site.

The Sitemap configuration data exposes the ability for other parts of the Interaction Studio platform to register and receive events from the client context. This article presents guidance to Sitemap developers for configuring the JavaScript components of a Sitemap required to implement the Interaction Studio web channel solution architecture. For a more complete introduction to the Sitemap, see Sitemap Overview . Sitemap Development Process \u00b6 To develop a Sitemap, do the following: 1. Navigate to the site that contains the Interaction Studio JavaScript Web SDK. 2. Launch the Interaction Studio Visual Editor and login. See Install and Use the Interaction Studio Launcher for more information on installing and starting the Interaction Studio Visual Editor. ![Launch Interaction Studio](Interaction-Studio-Launcher.png) Click the Sitemap launcher highlighted below to open the Sitemap Editor. In the Sitemap JS tab of the Sitemap Editor, configure the JavaScript components required for your Sitemap as described in the remainder of this article. Sitemap JavaScript Configuration Overview \u00b6 A Sitemap is built and initialized after the Interaction Studio Web SDK is initialized. Developing a Sitemap consists of writing the JavaScript required to do the following: Initialize the Web SDK Configure the Sitemap JavaScript objects Initialize the Sitemap Sitemap JavaScript Code Structure \u00b6 The general JavaScript code structure for a Sitemap is as follows: Evergage.init({ // Initializes the Interaction Studio Web SDK cookieDomain: \"company.com\" // Optional tracking cookie domain config (overrides default) }).then(() => { const sitemapConfig = { // Sitemap configuration object global: {}, // Object used to contain Global site object config pageTypes: [] // Array used to contain the page type object configs } Evergage.initSitemap(sitemapConfig); // Initializes the Sitemap }); The following sections present the considerations and guidance for developing each Sitemap functional component. For examples of complete Sitemap configurations, see Example Sitemaps . 1. Initializing the Interaction Studio Web SDK \u00b6 At the beginning of the Sitemap JavaScript, the Interaction Studio Web SDK (formerly Evergage) must be initialized with the following function: Evergage.init({ }).then(() => { } ---Sitemap Configuration--- This function initializes the Interaction Studio Web SDK and allows it to begin tracking. The Web SDK will only start tracking if Evergage.init() is called. Specifying an Optional Configuration of the Web SDK \u00b6 Developers can specify an optional configuration of the Web SDK by setting config object parameters for the Evergage.init function. These parameters are strictly optional and are not required for the Sitemap to function correctly. The following table lists the optional parameters accepted by the config object: Field Name Expected Value Type Required Description account string No Overrides the default Interaction Studio account to use for tracking dataset string No Overrides the default Interaction Studio dataset to use for tracking trackerUrl string No Overrides the default URL where the tracker sends events cookieDomain string No Overrides the default domain used for setting the Interaction Studio tracking cookie You should use the account , dataset , and trackerUrl parameters exclusively in your staging environment for testing purposes and never in your production environment. You can use these parameters to configure Sitemap operations to occur in your sandbox or learning environment without disrupting your production environment. On the other hand, you can use the cookieDomain parameter in the production environment in scenarios where you need to share the tracking cookie across all possible subdomains of the default site host. For example, if the default site host is something.company.com , the tracking cookie will only be set on that host by default. You can override this domain to share the cookie across all subdomains of company.com with the following configuration: Evergage.init({ cookieDomain: 'company.com' }); Optional Web SDK config parameter example \u00b6 The following code sample shows an optional configuration of the Web SDK using config object parameters: Evergage.init({ account: \"development\" dataset: \"staging\" trackerUrl: \"https://staging.company.com\" cookieDomain: \"staging.company.com\" }); Note: As mentioned above, you should use the account , dataset , and trackerUrl parameters only in your staging or learning environment and never in your production environment. However, you can use the cookieDomain parameter in your production or staging environment as needed. 2. Configuring the Sitemap Objects \u00b6 The const sitemapConfig variable is used to configure the JavaScript objects that capture site visitor actions. The optional global object can be used to define what user actions should be captured on every page that is matched as a page type. The pageTypes array is used to contain the configurations of one or more specific page types in a site. A Sitemap developer must configure one global object and the pageTypes array must have a page type object configured for each page type on the site. Common Object Configuration Examples \u00b6 A Sitemap can accept any valid JavaScript. Some JavaScript objects from the Interaction Studio Web SDK are required to support the functionality of Interaction Studio data collection and transmission. Some are required in the pageTypes array configuration but not used in the global object. The JavaScript objects from the Web SDK that are commonly used in the Sitemap global and page type configurations are described in the following table. Object Purpose Usage Configuration contentZones Array of objects used to indicate area(s) of a page that are eligible for customization Optional Global object or configured page type listeners Array of listener() functions used to listen for user actions that trigger events to send to Interaction Studio Optional Global object or configured page type isMatch Function required (along with the page name) to match a specific page type Required Configured page type only catalog Object used to collect and send data on catalog items Optional Configured page type only order Object used to collect and send order data to Interaction Studio, including line items, order IDs, total order value, and currency Context-dependent Configured page type only action Property of ActionEvent which is used to identify user actions sent to Interaction Studio Context-dependent Global object or configured page type itemAction Property of ActionEvent used to identify user actions taken on catalog items such as \"Purchase\" or \"AddToCart\" Context-dependent Configured page type only onActionEvent Function used with ActionEvent that sends events to Interaction Studiio based on user actions Optional Global object or configured page type Resolvers \u00b6 The resolvers are a set of properties provided by the Web SDK to help developers return the values of page elements and attributes. Resolvers can be used with some of the objects in the above table such as catalog to more easily return item information. Resolvers return functions so that they can be invoked after a page has been matched. When used in a page type configuration, the returned functions do not need to be invoked in order to get the final value as the underlying Sitemap code will handle that logic. The following example shows resolvers used to return information on line items on an e-Commerce site. For detailed guidance on implementing resolvers and a complete list of the available resolvers , see Sitemap Implementation Notes . lineItems: { _id: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttributeMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .line-item-quanity-info\", \"data-pid\"), price: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .pricing\"), quantity: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .qty-card-quantity-count\"), } Common Object Configuration Examples \u00b6 The following sections describe and present example configurations of the common Sitemap objects in the preceding table. The example configurations presented here are taken from the complete e-Commerce Example Sitemap . Content Zones \u00b6 Content Zones are used to designate one or more areas of a page as available for customization in customer engagement campaigns. This functionality is implemented using a contentZones array. Individual Content Zones consist of a name and a selector . The name is defined by the developer and should indicate the location on the page of the zone. The selector is used to indicate the HTML element that is eligible for personalization. Content Zones can be defined without a selector , meaning there is no designated HTML element associated with the Content Zone. This usage supports abandonment popups that display when a user begins to browse away from the page. The following are examples of Content Zone configurations. See Content Zones for additional information and examples of commonly used Content Zones. // Example: \"Header\" and \"Footer\" Content Zones defined in global object configuration contentZones: [ {name: \"global_infobar_top_of_page\", selector: \"header.site-header\"}, {name: \"global_infobar_bottom_of_page\", selector: \"footer.site-footer\"} ], // Example: Content Zones defined for product recommendation rows in product detail page type contentZones: [ { name: \"product_detail_recs_row_1\", selector: \".row.recommendations div[id*='cq']:nth-of-type(1)\"}, { name: \"product_detail_recs_row_2\", selector: \".row.recommendations div[id*='cq']:nth-of-type(2)\"}, ], // Example: \"Logical\" Content Zone defined with no selector for popup in global object configuration contentZones: [ { name: \"global_popup\" } ], ``` ##### Listeners Sitemap listeners are used to listen for user actions on a page, capture information from the action, and send the action and information to Interaction Studio. Listeners may be used in the global object configuration and in specific page types. Below are examples of listeners configured in the global config and product detail page type. See [Sitemap Implementation Notes](/web-integration/sitemap/sitemap-implementation-notes) for details on implementing Sitemap listeners. ```js // Example: Listener on global object for email sign-up that captures user email listeners: [ Evergage.listener(\"submit\", \".email-signup\", () => { const email = Evergage.cashDom(\"#dwfrm_mcsubscribe_email\").val(); if (email) { Evergage.sendEvent({action: \"Email Sign Up - Footer\", user: {id: email} }); } }), ], // Example: Listener on product detail page for add-to-cart action that captures product line item added listeners: [ Evergage.listener(\"click\", \".add-to-cart\", () => { const lineItem = Evergage.util.buildLineItemFromPageState(\"select[id*=quantity]\"); lineItem.sku = { _id: Evergage.cashDom(\".product-detail[data-pid]\").attr(\"data-pid\") }; Evergage.sendEvent({ itemAction: Evergage.ItemAction.AddToCart, cart: { singleLine: { Product: lineItem } } }); }), ], isMatch \u00b6 The isMatch property is a required component of each page type configuration in the pageTypes array. The isMatch property must declare a function that tells Interaction Studio how to determine what type of page the user is viewing. An isMatch function can return a boolean or a Promise that resolves a boolean. // Example: isMatch property using the Web SDK cashDom function to return the \"Product-Show\" DOM element which // would indicate the user is on the Product Detail (\"product_detail\") page type. name: \"product_detail\", isMatch: () => { return Evergage.cashDom(\"div.page[data-action='Product-Show']\").length > 0; } // Example: isMatch property using a regex expression to return the window href \"/cart\" which would indicate // the user is on the shopping cart (\"cart\") page type. name: \"cart\", isMatch: () => /\\/cart/.test(window.location.href), // Example: isMatch property that returns a Promise name: \"cart\", isMatch: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".cart-empty, .cart\", \"html\").then(() => true); } Catalog \u00b6 The catalog object is used to collect and send information about the catalog items with which a user is interacting. When tracking a catlog item, _id is a required field. For the _id , categories and dimensions fields, a Promise can be returned. When returning Promises for these fields, the event will only be tracked if the _id , categories and dimensions attributes all resolve. IMPORTANT: Catalog items and attributes must be added through the Interaction Studio UI before they can be used in a Sitemap. Some item attributes like _id , name and description are built into every catalog item by default. Additional ones can be added within the Interaction Studio UI as needed. The following shows an example of a catalog object for a product detail page type. catalog: { Product: { _id: () => { return Evergage.util.resolveWhenTrue.bind(() => { const productId = Evergage.cashDom(\".product-id\").first().text(); const products = getProductsFromDataLayer(); if (products && products.length > 0) { return products[0].id; } else if (productId) { return productId; } else { return false; } }) }, sku: { _id: Evergage.cashDom(\".product-detail[data-pid]\").attr(\"data-pid\") }, name: Evergage.resolvers.fromJsonLd(\"name\"), description: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelector(\".short-description\"), url: Evergage.resolvers.fromHref(), imageUrl: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttribute(\".product-carousel .carousel-item[data-slick-index='0'] img\", \"src\"), inventoryCount: 1, price: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelector(\".prices .price .value\"), rating: () => { return Evergage.util.extractFirstGroup(/([.\\w]+) out of/, Evergage.cashDom(\".ratings .sr-only\").text()); }, categories: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".container .product-breadcrumb .breadcrumb a\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.buildCategoryId(\".container .product-breadcrumb .breadcrumb a\", null, null, (categoryId) => [categoryId.toUpperCase()]); }); }, dimensions: { Gender: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".product-breadcrumb .breadcrumb a, h1.product-name\", \"html\").then((ele) => { if (Evergage.cashDom(\".product-breadcrumb .breadcrumb a\").first().text().toLowerCase() === \"women\" || Evergage.cashDom(\"h1.product-name\").text().indexOf(\"Women\") >= 0) { return [\"WOMEN\"]; } else if (Evergage.cashDom(\".product-breadcrumb .breadcrumb a\").first().text().toLowerCase() === \"men\" || Evergage.cashDom(\"h1.product-name\").text().indexOf(\"Men\") >= 0) { return [\"MEN\"]; } else { return; } }); }, Color: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".attributes\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttributeMultiple(\".color-value\", \"data-attr-value\"); }); }, Feature: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".features\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorMultiple(\".features .feature\", (features) => { return features.map((feature) => { return feature.trim(); }); }); }); } } } } Cart \u00b6 The cart object is typically used in the shopping cart pages of e-Commerce sites to collect information about the line items, including the item ID (or SKU), price, and quantity. The following shows an example of an cart object. For a cart object, the _id , price and quantity fields can return a Promise. When returning Promises for these fields, an event will only be sent if all Promises resolve. Note 1: complete is used to update the state of the cart in Evergage, setting it's content to the provided line items. Previous cart contents will be replaced. Note 2: _id must be defined under item type, however you can pass SKU values here if they are properly attributed to a product. cart: { complete: { Product: { _id: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".cart-empty, .product-info .product-details .line-item-quanity-info\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttributeMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .line-item-quanity-info\", \"data-pid\") }) }, price: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".cart-empty, .product-info .product-details .pricing\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .pricing\"); }) }, quantity: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded('.cart-empty, .product-info .product-details .qty-card-quantity-count', \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .qty-card-quantity-count\"); }); }, } } } Order \u00b6 The order object is typically used in the order confirmation pages of e-Commerce sites to collect information about the line items in a transaction, including the item ID (or SKU), price, and quantity. For an order object, all fields can return promises. When returning promises, an event will only be sent when all Promises resolve. The following shows an example of an order object. Note 1: The resolver functions in the Interaction Studio Web SDK are especially useful in simplifying the retrieval of this data. Note 2: _id must be defined under lineItems , however you can pass SKU values here if they are properly attributed to a product. order: { Product: { orderId: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".order-number\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelector(\".order-number\"); }); }, lineItems: { _id: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".product-line-item line-item-quanity-info\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttributeMultiple(\".product-line-item .line-item-quanity-info\", \"data-pid\"); }); }, price: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".product-line-item .pricing\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttributeMultiple(\".product-line-item .pricing\", \"data-pid\"); }); }, quantity: () => { return Evergage.DisplayUtils.pageElementLoaded(\".product-line-item .qty-card-quantity-count\", \"html\").then((ele) => { return Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttributeMultiple(\".product-line-item .qty-card-quantity-count\", \"data-pid\"); }); } } } } Action \u00b6 The action property provides a way for Interaction Studio to name user actions such as the viewing of the page or signing up for an email subscription. Often an action will be included after the name in the page type specification. The following would send a \"Login\" action to Interaction Studio every time a user accesses the login page type. { name: login action: Login isMatch: () => /\\/login/.test(window.location.href) } itemAction \u00b6 An itemAction is used when a user takes a specific action related to an item in the catalog. Some itemAction examples include: * AddToCart * Comment * Purchase For the complete list of itemAction values, see the Web SDK Typedoc . Some examples of the itemAction in Sitemap code are shown below. // Example: Send Add-to-cart item action as event Evergage.sendEvent({ itemAction: Evergage.ItemAction.AddToCart cart: { singleLine: { Product: lineItem } } }); // Example: View-cart item action on shopping cart page name: \"cart\", isMatch: () => /\\/cart/.test(window.location.href), itemAction: Evergage.ItemAction.ViewCart cart: { //cart config } // Example: Purchase item action on order confirmation page name: \"order_confirmation\", isMatch: () => /\\/confirmation/.test(window.location.href), itemAction: Evergage.ItemAction.Purchase, order: { //order config } onActionEvent \u00b6 The onActionEvent function is used with the ActionEvent property to send events to Interaction Studio based on user actions. The following is an example of the onActionEvent function in the pageType configuration: pageTypes: [ { name: \"search\", isMatch: () => /\\/search/.test(window.location.pathname), onActionEvent: (actionEvent) => { const searchTerm = Evergage.cashDom(\".content.searchTerm\").text().trim(); if (searchTerm) { actionEvent.user = actionEvent.user || {}; actionEvent.user.attributes = actionEvent.user.attributes || {}; actionEvent.user.attributes.lastSearchTerm = searchTerm; }; return actionEvent; } }, ] Configuring the Global Sitemap Object \u00b6 The global{} Sitemap configuration object allows you to define what should be captured on every page that is matched as a page type. This allows for Content Zones, listeners, locale and an onActionEvent functions to be defined for every page that is matched instead of only on individually matched pages. The following shows an example of a global Sitemap configuration. Evergage.init({ cookieDomain: \"northerntrailoutfitters.com\" }).then(() => { const sitemapConfig = { global: { contentZones: [ {name: \"global_infobar_top_of_page\", selector: \"header.site-header\"}, {name: \"global_infobar_bottom_of_page\", selector: \"footer.site-footer\"}, {name: \"global_popup\" } ], listeners: [ Evergage.listener(\"submit\", \".email-signup\", () => { const email = Evergage.cashDom(\"#dwfrm_mcsubscribe_email\").val(); if (email) { Evergage.sendEvent({action: \"Email Sign Up - Footer\", user: {id: email} }); } }), ], }, pageTypes: [ // ...page type configurations...] } Evergage.initSitemap(sitemapConfig); }); Configuring the Page Type Array Objects \u00b6 A Sitemap configuration consists of the global configuration (described above) which runs for all page types and an array of individual page type configurations. At a minimum, a page type requires configuring a name and an isMatch function. The name defines the name of the page type, while the isMatch function output is evaluated to determine if the page the user is on is a match for the page config. After name and isMatch , any of the sitemapConfig objects mentioned in this article may be used in a page type configuration object. { name: string isMatch: () => boolean | () => Promise<boolean> } isMatch accepts a function that returns a boolean or a function that returns a Promise. The sitemap will only evaluate the first page type whose isMatch resolves to true. If no page types match, no event will be sent to Interaction Studio. The following shows a few examples of different page type configurations. See Example Sitemaps for additional page type configuration examples and examples of complete Sitemaps. Evergage.init({ cookieDomain: \"northerntrailoutfitters.com\" }).then(() => { const config = { global: { onActionEvent: (actionEvent) => { const email = Evergage.util.getValueFromNestedObject(\"window._etmc.user_info.email\"); if (email) { actionEvent.user = actionEvent.user || {}; actionEvent.user.attributes = actionEvent.user.attributes || {}; actionEvent.user.attributes.emailAddress = email; } return actionEvent; }, contentZones: [ {name: \"global_infobar_top_of_page\", selector: \"header.site-header\"}, {name: \"global_infobar_bottom_of_page\", selector: \"footer.site-footer\"} ], listeners: [ Evergage.listener(\"submit\", \".email-signup\", () => { const email = Evergage.cashDom(\"#dwfrm_mcsubscribe_email\").val(); if (email) { Evergage.sendEvent({action: \"Email Sign Up - Footer\", user: {attributes: {emailAddress: email}}}); } }), ], }, pageTypes: [ { name: \"home\", action: \"Homepage\", isMatch: () => /\\/homepage/.test(window.location.href), contentZones: [ {name: \"home_hero\", selector: \".experience-carousel-bannerCarousel\"}, {name: \"home_sub_hero\", selector: \".experience-carousel-bannerCarousel + .experience-component\"}, {name: \"home_popup\"} ] }, { name: \"login\", action: \"Login\", isMatch: () => /\\/login/.test(window.location.href) && window.location.hostname !== \"community.northerntrailoutfitters.com\", listeners: [ Evergage.listener(\"click\", \"form[name='login-form'] button\", () => { const email = Evergage.cashDom(\"#login-form-email\").val(); if (email) { Evergage.sendEvent({action: \"Logged In\", user: {attributes: {emailAddress: email}}}); } }) ] }, { name: \"cart\", isMatch: () => { if (\\/cart/.test(window.location.href)) { return Evergage.DisplayUtil.pageElementLoaded(\".cart-empty, .cart\", \"html\").then(() => true); } else { return false; } }, itemAction: Evergage.ItemAction.ViewCart, cart: { complete: { Product: { _id: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorAttributeMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .line-item-quanity-info\", \"data-pid\"), price: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .pricing\"), quantity: Evergage.resolvers.fromSelectorMultiple(\".product-info .product-details .qty-card-quantity-count\"), } } } } ] }; Evergage.initSitemap(config); }); 3. Initializing the Sitemap \u00b6 A Sitemap is initialized at the end of the JavaScript code by calling Evergage.initSitemap(sitemapConfig) . Events will not be sent to Interaction Studio unless the sitemap is initialized with Evergage.initSitemap(sitemapConfig) and a matching page type is found. Evergage.init({ cookieDomain: \"developer.evergage.com\" }).then(() => { const sitemapConfig = { global: {...global object configuration...}, pageTypes: [...page type array configuration...] } Evergage.initSitemap(sitemapConfig); });","title":"Get Started with Sitemapping"},{"location":"web-integ/site-map-getting-started/#sitemap-development-process","text":"To develop a Sitemap, do the following: 1.

Resolvers can be used with some of the objects in the above table such as catalog to more easily return item information. Resolvers return functions so that they can be invoked after a page has been matched. When used in a page type configuration, the returned functions do not need to be invoked in order to get the final value as the underlying Sitemap code will handle that logic.

This functionality is implemented using a contentZones array. Individual Content Zones consist of a name and a selector . The name is defined by the developer and should indicate the location on the page of the zone. The selector is used to indicate the HTML element that is eligible for personalization. Content Zones can be defined without a selector , meaning there is no designated HTML element associated with the Content Zone. This usage supports abandonment popups that display when a user begins to browse away from the page. The following are examples of Content Zone configurations. See Content Zones for additional information and examples of commonly used Content Zones. // Example: \"Header\" and \"Footer\" Content Zones defined in global object configuration contentZones: [ {name: \"global_infobar_top_of_page\", selector: \"header.site-header\"}, {name: \"global_infobar_bottom_of_page\", selector: \"footer.site-footer\"} ], // Example: Content Zones defined for product recommendation rows in product detail page type contentZones: [ { name: \"product_detail_recs_row_1\", selector: \".row.recommendations div[id*='cq']:nth-of-type(1)\"}, { name: \"product_detail_recs_row_2\", selector: \".row.recommendations div[id*='cq']:nth-of-type(2)\"}, ], // Example: \"Logical\" Content Zone defined with no selector for popup in global object configuration contentZones: [ { name: \"global_popup\" } ], ``` ##### Listeners Sitemap listeners are used to listen for user actions on a page, capture information from the action, and send the action and information to Interaction Studio.

A Sitemap is developed to integrate with a specific site using the Web SDK, which map key business objects into the Interaction Studio system through event capture. This can include page type information and catalog items, supporting the ability to understand user interests against the catalog. It includes items such as products, article content, and categories, and can also include other user-specified dimensions (categorical information about other items with attributes that are entered by a user in the Interaction Studio UI). See Sitemap Overview for an introduction to the Interaction Studio Sitemap feature and Data Model for details on the Interaction Studio data model. Article Topics \u00b6 This article covers the following Sitemap implementation topics: * Sitemap Configuration Type Definitions * Sitemap API * Resolvers * Utility Functions * Single Page App (SPA) Handling * Sitemap Localization Implementation Example Sitemaps \u00b6 See example sitemaps here Sitemap Configuration Type Definitions \u00b6 A SiteMapConfig is comprised of three separate configurations: global , pageTypes (array), and pageTypeDefault . These configuration types are defined as follows: Global: Contains the objects that should be monitored on all page type configuration objects and the default page configuration (if defined). Page Types: Contains the objects used to detect/match each different page type to be monitored on the site. Default Page Configuration: If defined, the objects configured in a DefaultPageConfig will match when all PageConfig objects in the pageTypes array resolve to false . The following sections describe how the above Sitemap configuration types are processed and provides additional information on each configuration type. SiteMapConfig Type Processing \u00b6 When a PageConfig inside the pageTypes array matches a page on the site, or if the pageTypeDefault matches as described above, the matched config will merge with anything defined in GlobalConfig . The merge for individual attributes occurs in the following manner: locale : the matched PageConfig or DefaultPageConfig takes precedence contentZones : concatenate listeners : concatenate onActionEvent : the function for the matched PageConfig or DefaultPageConfig executes first, followed by the function for the GlobalConfig The result of this merge will then be evaluated as expected. { global: GlobalConfig, pageTypeDefault: DefaultPageConfig, pageTypes: PageConfig[] } Global Config \u00b6 Defines what additional data will be tracked if a PageConfig or DefaultPageConfig matches for a specific page { locale?: string | () => string, contentZones?: ContentZone[], listeners?: Listener[], onActionEvent?: (event: ActionEvent) => ActionEvent } Page Types \u00b6 Page type configurations use a pageTypes array to declare how to detect that a given URL or loaded page is one of the known page types. Each page type config must contain an isMatch property declaring the function that will be used to detect that page type. Additionally, individual page type configurations may declare Content Zones that represent key parts of a page designed for personalization adjustments. The configs may also declare other event listeners for a given page type, such as an \"add to cart\" listener. Page types may map to more than a single page. For example, the product display page (PDP) type would have separate URLs for every product in the site, but only a single page type. The Home page is an example of a page type that would have only a single instance of a page. For additional documentation on pageTypes click here . PageConfig \u00b6 Defines what data will be tracked for a specific page { name: string, // required isMatch: () => boolean | () => Promise<boolean>, // required locale?: string | () => string, action?: string, catalog?: CatalogConfig, cart?: CartConfig, order?: OrderConfig, contentZones?: ContentZone[], listeners?: Listener[], onActionEvent?: (event: ActionEvent) => ActionEvent } name The page type that gets sent in the event when this config is evaluated. isMatch: () => boolean | Promise<boolean> The function provided here is evaluated when the sitemap is deciding which PageConfig to evaluate. The sitemap will only evaluate the first PageConfig whose isMatch resolves to true. If no isMatch resolves to true , then the pageTypeDefault config will run. locale The locale of the page (e.g, en_US ). Only use if you have catalog localization enabled. action The name of the action that gets sent in the event when this config is evaluated. catalog See CatalogConfig cart See CartConfig order See OrderConfig contentZones The content zones defined in the sitemap determine where Evergage campaigns are rendered throughout a website. Evergage templates reference these content zones for targeting within campaigns. Below is an example of a ContentZone { name: Hero Image, selector: '#hero img' } Note that name is the only required field for ContentZones. listeners See Listeners onActionEvent(event: ActionEvent) => ActionEvent This function will run whenever the sitemap builds an ActionEvent and is about to send it to Evergage. This can occur as a result of building a PageConfig or calling Evergage.sendEvent . Use this to modify the outgoing ActionEvent . If this function exists on both the GlobalConfig and a matched PageConfig , then both will be run, with the function in the PageConfig running first, followed by the one in the GlobalConfig . CatalogConfig \u00b6 catalog: { <ItemType>: { _id: string | () => string | () => Promise<string | () => string> // required categories?: string[] | () => string[] | () => Promise<string[] | () => string[]> <attributes>?: value | () => value, dimensions?: { <dimension>?: string[] | () => string[] | () => Promise<string[] | () => string[]> }, attributes?: { <attribute>?: value | () => value } } } ItemType The ItemType is defined in the Catalog Setup section of the Evergage platform.

CartConfig \u00b6 cart: { complete: { <ItemType>: LineItem[] } } ItemType OrderConfig \u00b6 order: { <ItemType>: { orderId: string | () => string | Promise<string | () => string>, totalValue?: double | () => double | Promise<double | () => double>, currency?: string | () => string | Promise<string | () => string>, lineItems: LineItem[] } } LineItem \u00b6 { _id: string | () => string | Promise<string | () => string> price: double | () => double | Promise<value | ()=> double> quantity: integer | () => integer | Promise<value | ()=> integer> } CatalogConfig utility functions \u00b6 There is a utility function under Evergage.util that is especially helpful for building lineItems. buildLineItemFromPageState(quantitySelector) => LineItem Returns a LineItem constructed from the data already captured on the page, using the given quantitySelector to determine how many of the item are in the lineItem. Default Page Config \u00b6 Defines what data will be tracked only if all other PageConfig s resolve to false { name: string, // required locale?: string | () => string, contentZones?: ContentZone[], listeners?: Listener[], onActionEvent?: (event: ActionEvent) => ActionEvent } Sitemap API \u00b6 The Sitemap API is scoped on the window under Evergage . Evergage.initSitemap(siteMapConfig: *SiteMapConfig*) => void Initialize the sitemap process, using the provided config. Events will not be sent to Evergage unless this function is called. Evergage.cashDom(selector: *String*, context) => Cash A small library for modern browsers that provides jQuery style syntax to wrap modern Vanilla JS features and select elements from the DOM. For more information on Cash , see the docs on GitHub . Evergage.sendEvent(event: *ActionEvent*) Send a custom event to Interaction Studio. Evergage.getState() Get the current page state, including values in the config that have already been resolved. Listeners \u00b6 Evergage.listener(bind: keyof WindowEventMap, selector: string, callback: Function): Listener; Create a new listener. A listener is a way to take some action upon an event happening on a page. It is structured similarly to jQuery's event listeners. Below is an example of a simple listener . It binds a click to the banner of a website and fires an event to Evergage. Evergage.listener(\"click\", \".header-banner\", () => { Evergage.sendEvent({action: \"Banner Click\"}) }) Here is an example of an email capture, using a custom callback function: Evergage.listener(\"submit\", \"form#subscribe\", (e) => { const userEmail = Evergage.cashDom(e.target).find(\"#email\").val(); if (typeof userEmail === 'string' && /^.+@.+\\..+$/.test(userEmail)) { Evergage.sendEvent({ action: 'Email Capture', user: { attributes: { emailAddress: userEmail } } }); } }) Resolvers \u00b6 Evergage.resolvers.<resolver> Resolvers return functions so that they can be invoked after a page has been matched. When used in a PageConfig , the returned functions do not need to be invoked in order to get the final value - the underlying sitemap code will handle that logic. The transform functions are callbacks designed to evaluate or modify the resolved value. fromSelector(selector: string, transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Evergage.cashDom(selector).text() Returns the text of the first instance of the selector in the DOM. fromSelectorMultiple(selector: string, transform?: (string[]) => string[]) => () => string[] [Evergage.cashDom(selector).eq(0).text(), Evergage.cashDom(selector).eq(1).text(), ...] Returns the text of all instances of the selector in the DOM in an array. fromSelectorAttribute(selector: string, attribute: string, transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Evergage.cashDom(selector).attr(attribute) Returns the attribute of the first instance of the selector in the DOM. fromSelectorAttributeMultiple(selector: string, attribute: string, transform?: (string[]) => string[]) => () => string[] [Evergage.cashDom(selector).eq(0).attr(attribute), Evergage.cashDom(selector).eq(1).attr(attribute), ...] Returns the attributes of the of all instances of the selector in the DOM as an array. fromMeta(metaName: string, transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Evergage.cashDom(\"meta[name='\" + metaName + \"']\").first().attr(\"content\") Returns the content of the first meta tag with the given meta tag name. fromItemProp(itemProp: string, transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Evergage.cashDom(\"[itemprop='\" + itemProp + \"']\").first().attr(\"content\") Returns the content of the first item prop with the given item prop. fromWindow(windowVar: string, transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Returns the value from a nested object. Returns null if the nested object, or some object in the path, does not exist. fromJsonLd(path: string, transform?: any) => () => any Evergage.cashDom(\"script[type='application/ld+json']\").first().text() If the path is null, the first JSON-LD script is returned after being parsed into a JavaScript object. If a path is provided, then the value of the path from parsed JavaScript object will be returned. buildCategoryId(selector: string, startFrom?: integer, ignoreLast?: boolean, transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Evergage.cashDom(selector).eq(startFrom).text()|Evergage.cashDom(selector).eq(startFrom+1).text()|... Returns a pipe delimited string using the text of all instances of the selector. buildCategoryIdAttribute(selector: string, attribute: string, startFrom?: integer, ignoreLast?: boolean, transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Evergage.cashDom(selector).eq(startFrom).attr(attribute)|Evergage.cashDom(selector).eq(startFrom+1).attr(attribute)|... Returns a pipe delimited string using the given attribute of all instances of the selector. fromCanonical(transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Returns a canonical URL, if one exists on the page. fromHref(transform?: (string) => string) => () => string Returns the value stored in window.location.href Utility Functions \u00b6 Evergage.util.<util> The Evergage WebSDK provides a number of utility functions that can be used to help parse data. buildLineItemFromPageState(quantitySelector: string) => LineItem Returns a LineItem constructed from the data already captured on the page, using the given quantitySelector to determine how many of the item are in the lineItem. extractFirstGroup(regex: RegExp, str: string) => string Returns a string of the first group extracted from the provided regex. getFloatValue(text: string) => number Returns a floating point number parsed from the provided string. getIntegerValue(text: string) => number Returns an integer number parsed from the provided string. getLastPathComponent(url: string) => string Returns the last path component for the provided URL. For example Evergage.util.getLastPathComponent(\"https://example.example/myExamplePath.html\") returns myExamplePath.html . getLastPathComponentWithoutExtension(url: string) => string Returns the last path component without an extension for the provided URL. For example Evergage.util.getLastPathComponent(\"https://example.example/myExamplePath.html\") returns myExamplePath . getParameterByName(name: string, url?: string) => string Returns the value of the provided parameter name from the provided URL. If no URL provided, the current location.search of the page will be used. getPathname(url: string) => string Returns the pathname of the provided URL. getUtagFirstForField(fieldName: string) => any Returns the first value for the provided field in a window.utag_data object. getValueFromNestedObject(path: string, obj?: object) => any Returns the value from a nested object. If obj is not provided, window will be used. Returns null if the nested object, or some object in the path, does not exist. qualifyUrl(unqualified: string) => string Returns a qualified URL href from an unqualified relative URL path. If unqualified is null or unprovided, returns null. removeQueryString(url: string) => string Returns a URL without query strings from the provided URL. resolveWhenTrue.bind(trueFunc: () => any, bindId?: string timeout?: number, checkInterval?: number) => Promise<any> Returns a Promise that will resolve when the provided trueFunc evaluates to true . If timeout is not provided, a 2000 ms default timeout will be used. If checkInterval is not provided, a 100 ms default interval will be used to check the trueFunc. If the timeout is reached, the check will be unbound. An unbind function is provided under resolveWhenTrue.getBindings() . If a bindId is provided the unbind function will be mapped to that key, otherwise a new random key will be used. resolveWhenTrue.unbind(bindId: string) => void When given a bindId unbinds that bound resolveWhenTrue function. resolveWhenTrue.getBindings() => [key: string]: unbindFunction: () Returns a map of currently bound resolveWhenTrue functions. resolveWhenTrue.clearBindings() => void Clears all currently bound resolveWhenTrue functions. Single Page App Handling \u00b6 Use the following code to reinitialize the beacon and the sitemap when using Evergage on a single page app (SPA). Evergage.reinit() Executing the above code will have the following effects: Dispatch an Evergage.CustomEvents.OnInit event. Reinitialize the beacon with the same settings as the initial page load (e.g. cookieDomain ). Rerun the sitemap using the same config as the initial page load. Send activity timing for the previous page. Start activity timers for the current page. The above code should be wrapped in logic to determine when the beacon and sitemap should reinitialize. For example, to reinitialize the beacon and sitemap when the URL changes without a full page load, see the following sitemap. Note: The following sitemap is for illustrative purposes only. It is advisable to consider other ways of using this function that better suits your specific use case and the way your site functions. Evergage.init().then(() => { const config = { global: {}, pageTypes: [ { name: \"home\", isMatch: () => /home/.test(window.location.href); } ] }; /* Check for URL change every 2 seconds. If URL has changed, reinitialize beacon and sitemap. */ const handleSPAPageChange = () => { let url = window.location.href; const urlChangeInterval = setInterval(() => { if (url !== window.location.href) { url = window.location.href; Evergage.reinit(); } }, 2000); } handleSPAPageChange(); Evergage.initSitemap(config); }) Sitemap Localization Implementation \u00b6 Using the localization setting allows a single dataset to handle a site with multiple languages/locales while utilizing the same catalog and sitemap across languages/locale. To use catalog localizations the \"Localization of Catalog Metadata Based on Page Locale\" setting must be enabled in catalog settings. Using localizations requires sending the locale attribute in an event. In order to send an event with a locale, see the example of a View Item event below. Locale can be set on the global , pageTypeDefault and individual pageTypes in the SiteMapConfig and can be set manually in events tracked through Evergage.sendEvent . Locale needs to be set in a specific format of an ISO 639 alpha-2 language code followed by an underscore followed by an ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code. Some examples of valid locales are: \"en_US\" \"en_AU\" \"en_CA\" \"zh_CN\" \"en_GB\" \"pt_PT\" \"en_HK\" \"zh_HK\" Example: Setting Locale in Global Config \u00b6 Evergage.init().then(() => { const buildLocale = () => { let locale = Evergage.CashDom(\"meta[type='locale']\").attr(\"content\"); return locale; } const config = { global: { locale: buildLocale() }, pageTypeDefault: { name: \"default\" }, pageTypes: [ { name: \"home\", action: \"Homepage\", isMatch: () => { return window.location.pathname === \"/\"; } } ] } Evergage.initSitemap(config); }); Catalog Configs in Different Locales \u00b6 When building catalog configs in a sitemap, different locales can all use the same config. Since the localized attributes are all on the same item in Evergage, when selecting which _id to use for a Catalog Item or for a Catalog Item's dimensions, you will want to make sure you select an _id that does not change depending on the locale of the page. Failing to do so will create extra Catalog Items and Dimensions in the catalog and split attribution for users between different locales of the site. All item types can be localized. For products, you will want to make sure that currency is captured in the catalog along with price if available. currency takes a ISO_4217 3 character string currency code as its value and may change based on locale. catalog: { Product: { _id: getProductId(), name: getProductName(), price: getProductPrice(), currency: \"AUD\" } } }); Order Config in Different Locales \u00b6 When creating an order config on a dataset that includes locales an additional field in the order config is required to correctly calculate total revenue. currency takes a ISO_4217 3 character string currency code as its value. If no currency is provided the currency for items in the order object will be assumed to be the default currency set on the dataset. { ... order: { Product: { orderId: \"testOrder123\", totalValue: 120.25, currency: \"AUD\", lineItems: { _id: string[], price: double[], quantity: integer[] } } }, ... } Some examples of valid currency values are: \"USD\" \"AUD\" \"THB\" \"EUR\" \"BRL\" \"DKK\"","title":"Sitemap Implementation"},{"location":"web-integ/sitemap-implementation-notes/#article-topics","text":"This article covers the following Sitemap implementation topics: * Sitemap Configuration Type Definitions * Sitemap API * Resolvers * Utility Functions * Single Page App (SPA) Handling * Sitemap Localization Implementation","title":"Article Topics"},{"location":"web-integ/sitemap-implementation-notes/#example-sitemaps","text":"See example sitemaps here","title":"Example Sitemaps"},{"location":"web-integ/sitemap-implementation-notes/#sitemap-configuration-type-definitions","text":"A SiteMapConfig is comprised of three separate configurations: global , pageTypes (array), and pageTypeDefault .

The configs may also declare other event listeners for a given page type, such as an \"add to cart\" listener. Page types may map to more than a single page. For example, the product display page (PDP) type would have separate URLs for every product in the site, but only a single page type.

In Interaction Studio, the term Sitemap represents the JavaScript configuration through which the Interaction Studio web-channel solution architecture is implemented. An Interaction Studio developer must configure a Sitemap to be able to collect the user interactivity data on all desired website \"page types\" and support the business requirements to: * Develop web templates that enable the delivery of web channel campaigns to targeted prospects and customers * Enrich the company knowledge and data profiles of customers, prospects, products, and site content assets based on website visitor actions * Enable the development of in-depth behavioral analytics and machine learning capabilities Sitemap JavaScript Functionality \u00b6 The JavaScript configured in an Interaction Studio Sitemap provides the functionality that enables Interaction Studio to identify: * User Profiles: Who is interacting with the website (known user ID or anonymous user tracking ID), enabling the ability to develop a user profile based on user browsing actions and existing user data drawn from company systems. See Capturing User and Account Attributes and User Identity Mapping . * Page Types: Type of page the user is browsing (Home page, Product page, and so on). See Page Types . * Attributes: Detailed data on the attributes of the user and on the business objects that the user is interacting with, such as product or service catalog items or other web content on the site (blogs, articles, and so on). See Capturing User and Account Attributes and Attributes . * Content Zones: Areas of each web page type that Interaction Studio can monitor and target for personalized user engagement opportunities. See Content Zones * Events: Types of user activity to listen for that will trigger events to Interaction Studio. The JavaScript for an Interaction Studio Sitemap must be configured before development can begin on the Interaction Studio web templates that support customer engagement campaigns based on customer and prospect web channel interactions. Sitemap Blueprint \u00b6 As part of the Interaction Studio discovery process, a solution architect works with the Interaction Studio customer to understand the business context and determine the web-channel solution architecture that the Sitemap configuration will need to implement. The discovery process should produce a Sitemap Blueprint that provides the Sitemap developer with the following information: Site Catalog: The brands, products, services or other website content such as articles and blogs that Interaction Studio will need to monitor. This includes the specifications of product categories such as \"home goods\", \"camping\" and \"winter wear\" and individual product dimensions such as color, gender, and keyword. Site Architecture: Structure of the site and layout of page types. A large online retailer may have hundreds or even thousands of individual Product pages, but the structural layout of each Product page type will be the same. The Sitemap developer must understand the site architecture and the types of pages that require configuration in the Sitemap. Attribute Model: Attributes are used in a Sitemap to collect and store additional custom data for each business object type relevant to the business. Business objects that can have associated attributes include users, accounts, catalog items, orders, and line items. Attributes can also include metadata on on the attribute value such as the attribute data origin/provider, sensitivity classification (PII, sensitive, non-sensitive), and refresh date of the attribute value. Attributes provide additional information to Interaction Studio that Campaign developers can then use for targeting, segmentation, and machine learning purposes. An attribute model schema should be developed as part of the discovery process that specifies the individual attribute name/value pairs, associated metadata being used, and the purpose of each attribute. Web Engagement Use Cases: The Sitemap Blueprint will specify the use cases that explain how the business wants to engage with its prospects and customers through the website, and should include the Content Zone requirements for the site. Site Events: The types of actions done by users on the site that should be sent to Interaction Studio for the purpose of segmentation, campaign targeting, or behavioral tracking (machine learning). See Event API and Sitemap Implementation . Sitemap Integration and Configuration \u00b6 The Interaction Studio Sitemap system is deployed by and executes within a Beacon API and Web SDK developed by Salesforce for Interaction Studio. A Sitemap is integrated to a site by establishing a connection from the site to Interaction Studio through a <script> tag added in the site header. <script src = \"https://<Interaction Studio Deployment URL>/scripts/evergage.min.js\"></script> Sitemap configuration is done using the Sitemap Editor included with the Interaction Studio Visual Editor. Once the Web SDK script tag has been added to a site, the Sitemap Editor can be used to configure the site to support the Interaction Studio web channel solution. Using the Sitemap Editor, a developer can leverage the JavaScript functions provided by the Interaction Studio Web SDK library, and execute that functionality through HTTP requests to the Interaction Studio Event API . Note: HTTP requests are sent automatically by the Web SDK based on the configuration of the Sitemap. The Web SDK also provides an API to send events by calling a function (Evergage.sendEvent) from a Sitemap listener.

The traditional approach, where users are looked up using a primary ID, is described briefly. The rest of the article focuses on the new approach, where users are looked up using one or more identity attributes. The new approach is recommended for all new datasets, and existing datasets should transition to it. For additional information about how to configure identity types and attributes in the Interaction Studio UI, please see the Identity Management section of the Interaction Studio Knowledge Base . Terms \u00b6 The following terms are used on this page and in the Identity System: User - A record in Interaction Studio that attempts to track and personalize for one individual. Anonymous ID - An identifier generated by the Web SDK that typically stays the same on a given device. Named ID - An identifier set in the integration by calling setUser. Before the Identity feature was released, only one type of named ID was allowed per integration and per user (with the exception of Eloqua/Salesforce sync). Primary User ID - The internal identifier of the user record in Interaction Studio where the user's activity is tracked. Before the Identity feature was released, this was always an anonymous ID or named ID and was just called user ID . Identity - New concept with the release of the Identity feature. It connects an arbitrary number of identifiers of different types with each user by Primary User ID. Identity Type - The field used for identity matching. This can be things like email address or web user ID. Defined at the account level. Identity Attribute - Any user attribute that is associated with an identity type. These attributes can hold a user's individual identities. Defined per dataset, the attribute type must be either string or multistring. Identity Namespace - A uniqueness value that indicated that the identity attribute is unique to the dataset. Identity namespace is equivalent to the dataset. Resolve User ID - This command requests the primary user ID associated with the set of identities. Persisted User ID - Traditionally, the Web SDK remembered the user ID from the previous request using an opaque token that was encrypted by the server. Instead, with the new Identity feature the same encrypted token stores the primary user ID resolved by the server along with the set of identities (name and value) provided for the user in this visit. New identities are added/replaced as they are provided to the Web SDK . Uniqueness - This setting defines whether the identity attribute value is unique to only one profile in the dataset (Identity Namespace), such as an email address, and can be used for both lookup and merge, or can belong to multiple user profiles, such as home phone number or mailing address, so it can only be used as a way to filter a group of users. The Traditional Approach - Look Up Users via Primary ID \u00b6 Traditionally, Interaction Studio mapped incoming web events to a user based on the user.id property in the event. This ID represented the primary ID of the user entity stored by Interaction Studio. Once user.id was specified within a visit, the server would include the user ID in the the persistedUserId property in the event response, and the Web SDK would automatically include this encrypted form of the ID in subsequent events in the same visit. When the user.id property was not yet known, the Web SDK would automatically include an anonId property in the event, which contained a 16-character unique hexadecimal anonymous ID generated by the Web SDK . Interaction Studio would temporarily use this anoynmous ID as the user's primary ID and then automatically merge the user into a user with a named ID once an event was received with user.id set. Current Best Practice - Look Up Users Using Identity Attributes \u00b6 As of September 2020, Interaction Studio supports a more powerful way to map incoming events to users based on one or more identity attributes present in the event. To use this new functionality, the Pipeline Identity Resolution feature must be enabled for the tenant, and the identity system must be configured for the dataset as described in the Interaction Studio Knowledge Base. Once the dataset has been configured to use identity attributes for user identity resolution, users are looked up purely by identity attributes, rather than by primary ID. In fact, Interaction Studio will automatically generate a unique 24-character hexadecimal ID for new users. The primary ID is system-managed and can no longer be used to look up users. The new system is more powerful, because if the web ID is not known on a particular page, the user can still be identified by any other identifier that is known. For example, if a user clicks on a link in an email, the landing page URL might contain the user's email address or an ID assigned by the ESP. The email address or ESP ID could then be included in the event sent to Interaction Studio and used to look up an existing user. Configuring the Identity System \u00b6 The process for configuring the Interaction Studio Identity System is detailed in the Configure Identity Types and Attributes article in the Interaction Studio Knowledge Base and requires Interaction Studio administrator permissions. At a high-level you will need to: Review existing identity types - Interaction Studio comes with five pre-built identity types: email address, Salesforce CRM contact ID, Salesforce CRM lead ID, Salesforce Marketing Cloud contact key, and secondary email address. Add any additional identity types - You may need to add additional identity types to meet the needs of your business. Configure attributes that correspond to identity types - Even if you do not add additional identity types, you will need to configure the attributes that correspond to the default identity types listed above. Anonymous Users \u00b6 The Web SDK will include a generated anonymous ID in the user.anonId property in all events. However, Interaction Studio will only consider the event anonymous and use the anonymous ID as the user ID if neither user.id nor any identity attributes are present in the event (remember user.id now represents the main web user ID, not the primary ID of the user in Interaction Studio). If one or more identity attributes are present, they will be used to look up an existing user, and if not found, a new user with a server-generated primary ID will be created; the anonymous ID from the event will not be used. As always, once an anonymous user logs in or is otherwise identified, Interaction Studio will automatically merge their activity into the identified user's profile. Note, server-generated user IDs for identified users are 24 hexadecimal characters, versus Web-SDK-generated user IDs for anonymous users which are 16 hexadecimal characters. Persisted User ID \u00b6 The persistedUserId property in the event response continues to play an important role in web identity tracking. Traditionally, the persisted user ID was simply the encrypted user.id . Once the new identity resolution is enabled, it is still an encrypted string, but it is encoded in two parts instead: the server-resolved primary user ID the list of identity attribute name-value pairs that were used to resolve the primary user ID. This list is cumulative over the course of a visit. For example, if page 1 sends emailAddress=joe@example.com and page 2 sends loyaltyId=abc123 , both of these attributes will be used to resolve the user and encoded in the persisted user ID. As the Web SDK developer, you can include identity attributes in events as they are discovered and Interaction Studio will accumulate and remember those IDs for the remainder of the visit. You do not need to keep track of the set of discovered identity attributes. Previously, the Interaction Studio server would only include persistedUsedId in the response to the first event in a visit containing the user.id property. Once identity resolution is enabled, the server will include the latest persistedUserId in every event response subsequent to the user having been identified. The Web SDK will automatically save the most recently received persistedUserId in subsequent events. This means that the Interaction Studio server can reuse the resolved identity and does not have to perform redundant identity resolutions for every event. However, if an event contains a new identity attribute that is not already encoded in the persisted user ID, the server will perform a new identity resolution that takes into account the new identity. Sending Identities Through the Sitemap \u00b6 The default identity attribute you select as the Web SDK Identity can be supplied as the user.id in web events configured in the Sitemap . In addition to the default identity, Interaction Studio supports look-up and merge using the Web SDK for any other identity attributes supplied under user.attributes in web events. The set of all supplied identity attributes accumulates in the web browser. If there are changes to the default identity sent as user.id , Interaction Studio clears the set of all identity attributes stored on the client. This can happen when a different individual starts using the browser on the same device and logs in to a different account. Examples \u00b6 Scenario 1: Only web user ID is known \u00b6 webUserIdentityTypId is set to webId . The user's web ID is known, so the Web SDK sends an event containing: { user: { anonId: '0123456789abcdef', id: 'abc123' } } The Interaction Studio server will check for an existing user with a webId identity attribute with value abc123 . If found, the event activity will be tracked against that user. If not, a new user will be created with a generated primary ID, such as 8675309abacab5551212acdc , and attribute webId with value such as abc123 . If there was any previous activity for the anonymous user with ID 0123456789abcdef , that activity will be merged into the identified user. Note, an alternate way to send the same information would be through the following event: { user: { anonId: '0123456789abcdef', attributes: { webId: 'abc123' } } } Scenario 2: Only some other identity attribute is known \u00b6 webUserIdentityTypId is set to webId . The user's web ID is not known by the beacon, but the user's email address is known (this is a common scenario for an email clickthrough or a non-logged-in user who signs up for an email list), so the Web SDK sends an event containing: { user: { anonId: '0123456789abcdef', attributes: { emailAddress: 'billybob@example.com' } } } The Interaction Studio server will see if there is an existing user with a emailAddress identity attribute with value billybob@example.com . If found, the event activity will be tracked against that user. If not, a new user will be created with a generated primary ID, such as 8675309abacab5551212acdc , and attribute emailAddress with value billybob@example.com . If there was any previous activity for the anonymous user with ID 0123456789abcdef , that activity will be merged into the identified user. Scenario 3: Web user ID and another identity attribute are known but match two different users \u00b6 webUserIdentityTypId is set to webId . Both the user's web ID and email address are known, so the web SDK sends an event containing: { user: { anonId: '0123456789abcdef', id: 'abc123', attributes: { emailAddress: 'billybob@example.com' } } } The Interaction Studio server will check for existing users with webId identity attribute with a value of abc123 or emailAddress identity attribute with a value of billybob@example.com . Typically for a repeat visit, a single existing user will be matched, but it is possible that two users could be matched - one user with webId=abc123 and another user with emailAddress=billybob@example.com . When this occurs, the Interaction Studio server will select the user who was most recently active prior to this event. The activity from the other user will be automatically merged into the selected user, and the other user will be deleted from the system. The resulting user record will look like: { id: '8675309abacab5551212acdc', attributes: { webId: 'abc123', emailAddress: 'billybob@example.com' }, <merged activity from both matched users> } where 8675309abacab5551212acdc is the ID of the user that was selected based on having more recent activity than the other user.","title":"User Identity Mapping"},{"location":"web-integ/user-identity-mapping/#terms","text":"The following terms are used on this page and in the Identity System: User - A record in Interaction Studio that attempts to track and personalize for one individual.

Follow these steps in the correct order as guidance for planning your Interaction Studio web integration. Step 1: Implementation Planning \u00b6 Discovery \u00b6 During the Interaction Studio discovery process, a solution architect works with the Interaction Studio customer to understand the business context for the Interaction Studio web implementation, any web campaign requirements, and the web-channel solution architecture to implement. Ideally, the implementor will also come away from the discovery process with a deep understanding of the website's structure and what data is available for collection by Interaction Studio. The following list details all the tasks the implementation team carries out during this process. Establish the business context and goals of any web campaigns, along with requirements for the associated web templates. For specific technical documentation about Campaigns and Templates, see the Web Templates documentation on this site and the Web Campaigns and Templates documentation in the Interaction Studio business user knowledge base. Identify the identity attributes necessary for your implementation. Take careful consideration when deciding what identities to use; since identity setup is permanent, it has significant implications for your deployment. Refer to the documentation linked below for detailed information about how the identity system functions and how you can configure it for use with the web SDK. Identity Management Configure Identity Types and Attributes Configure the Identity System for the Web SDK Additional considerations: If the client is implementing multiple sites on one account, our Multisite Implementation Strategy documentation will be helpful. If the site is a Single Page Application (SPA), please refer to the Single Page App Handling documentation. Blueprint \u00b6 The site mapping blueprint is all about planning. A sitemap blueprint is a skeleton for the structure of your sitemap. It serves as a guide for the developer writing the sitemap code and a reference for those unfamiliar with a particular implementation. In the sitemap blueprint, you will define the page types to be mapped, how the platform should treat them, what relevant data is available on each page chosen for mapping, and where individual values to be collected are found within the site. Creating a good sitemap blueprint is the part of the implementation process that is key to developing the data model. Ensure that the decisions made during blueprinting make sense from a technical standpoint. For more information about data modeling, see the Data Modeling documentation. It's also essential to keep the client's use cases in mind while developing your blueprint to ensure you create a data model capable of supporting those cases. Additionally, creating the blueprint document should be a collaborative effort; it's crucial to involve both a business user and a technical resource familiar with the product throughout this process. Once the blueprint has the overall sitemap structure in detail, we recommend adding to the blueprint where each piece of data to be collected can be found on the client's website. Ensure that you call out all identities needed for this implementation in your blueprint. Finally, get your technical resource to validate whether the values for identity attributes are available on the site and/or through ETL and that all of the identity types you are planning to configure support your use cases. Step 2: Sitemap Development \u00b6 You can start the Interaction Studio web integration by deploying the JavaScript web beacon on all pages that Interaction Studio will monitor. Typically, the team or individual responsible for deploying software to the company website carries out this task. Validate the JavaScript Beacon deployment , either before or during the sitemap development process. Next, develop the sitemap configuration for all page types and test the sitemap data ingestion to ensure that it meets the anticipated web campaign requirements. For more information on the sitemap development process, see Sitemap Development . Use a Test Dataset During Development \u00b6 Leveraging a test dataset to hone your sitemap allows you to experiment during the early stages of the implementation process. It helps ensure that any data captured while working on a sitemap does not contaminate the data in your production environment., Any data captured in your production dataset will be factored into the catalog structure, campaign targeting logic, and machine learning recipe training. Hence, it is essential to avoid polluting your production dataset with unwanted data elements. Most importantly, editing and revising sitemap code directly in production can lead to incomplete and unvalidated code running live on the client's site. Creating and using a test dataset is a simple but critical measure to ensure safe sitemap iteration and a pristine production environment. You can create a test dataset by referring to the instructions listed in the Setup and Manage Datasets documentation. Note: Once you create a new dataset, you will not be able to delete it. Use the Interaction Studio Launcher to Work on Your Test Dataset with the Sitemap Editor \u00b6 First, Validate the JavaScript Beacon Deployment to check whether the site already has the JavaScript beacon installed. Then, install the Interaction Studio Launcher by referring to the Install and Use the Interaction Studio Launcher documentation. When using your test dataset and viewing the site in your browser, the option you enable on the Interaction Studio Launcher changes based on the presence of the JavaScript beacon. If the beacon is live on the site, enable Force Web SDK URL . If the beacon is not live on the site, enable Inject Web SDK . For more information on each of these scenarios, refer to the Interaction Studio Launcher documentation. Throughout the development process, remember to validate the events sent by your sitemap using all of the methods outlined in the Sitemap Event Validation documentation. Doing so will ensure that you identify any timing issues, errors, or unexpected behavior caused by your sitemap code as they occur. If you are capturing any data from a form as part of your sitemap, remember that it is best to collect form entry data upon form submission only . Doing this helps ensure that you are only collecting accurate data intended to be submitted by the user. It also ensures that your data has undergone and passed the same validation processes used to collect these values natively on the client site. Finally, ensure that all identities are configured appropriately according to the blueprint. To know more about configuring identity types and attributes, see Configure Identity Types and Attributes . SEE ALSO \u00b6 Sitemap Development in Interaction Studio Example Sitemaps: Example Financial Services Sitemap Example Ecommerce Sitemap Example B2B Sitemap Step 3: Sitemap Validation \u00b6 Once the implementor feels like they are in a good spot with their sitemap code, they should review their progress alongside the Best Practices for Data Capture Using Site Mapping . Then, after reviewing these practices and checking that their code works as intended, they can pass their code off for the next phase of code review within their own organization and make any adjustments based on feedback provided. Step 4: Moving an Approved Sitemap to Production \u00b6 Important: If the client's site already has the beacon corresponding to the production dataset integrated into their site, adding a sitemap code to that dataset immediately makes the implementation live and data collection begin. Ensure that the client is ready for this step before proceeding. This process involves ensuring that the production dataset is configured in the same way as the test dataset you have been using to ensure everything works as expected. Reproduce catalog setup from the test dataset in the production dataset. The catalog in the production dataset can be maintained throughout the development process to reflect the Catalog as it gets finalized in your test dataset. Paste the completed sitemap code into the production dataset. Make sure you are saving your sitemap code through the web Sitemap Editor accessed via the Visual Editor . Reproduce all recipes and segments created in the test dataset to support your use-cases and/or reporting efforts. Configure any third-party integrations from the test dataset in production. Configure any feeds from the test dataset in production. If development of campaigns and templates began in a test dataset, the following steps may also be required. Export templates from the test dataset and import them into production. Reproduce all campaigns created in the test dataset. Step 5: Create Templates and Campaigns \u00b6 Important: As a best practice, complete the sitemap and move it to production before creating any templates or campaigns. Ideally, all of your campaigns and templates will be created only once directly in the production dataset. Configure and test the web templates required to support the anticipated web campaigns. For guidance, refer to articles in the Campaign Development section of this site and the Web Campaigns and Templates documentation in the Interaction Studio business user knowledge base. Once you have developed your campaigns, debug them using the Web Campaign Debugger . You may also want to watch the Event API Responses directly in the Network tab of your browser\u2019s developer tools. If work on campaigns and templates in the production dataset needs to begin before the sitemap is complete, you can create campaigns and templates within your test dataset. However, be mindful of the following. Cloning a dataset does not carry over data, campaigns, or templates. If templates are built on a test dataset, you will have to individually export and then import each template from the test dataset into the production dataset before you go live with them. Campaigns built on the test dataset will have to be reproduced manually on the production dataset. Both templates and campaigns will rely on the sitemap in some way to function properly. Without a completed sitemap, it can be difficult to develop a template that will work long-term, considering that the sitemap is still in flux. Recipes and segmentation depend on the proper implementation of the sitemap based on the discovery and blueprinting processes.","title":"Plan a Web Integration"},{"location":"web-integ/web-integration-planning/#step-1-implementation-planning","text":"","title":"Step 1: Implementation Planning"},{"location":"web-integ/web-integration-planning/#discovery","text":"During the Interaction Studio discovery process, a solution architect works with the Interaction Studio customer to understand the business context for the Interaction Studio web implementation, any web campaign requirements, and the web-channel solution architecture to implement.

For a description of the Interaction Studio web integration process and development planning considerations, see Plan a Web Integration . Web SDK \u00b6 The Web SDK provides the functions, properties and methods that developers can use to collect information about website visitor browsing behavior and to send that information to Interaction Studio, allowing the company to build profiles of their website vistor/user behavior. The JavaScript beacon included with the Web SDK handles event responses containing personalization web Campaigns . These Campaigns are developed by business users through the Interaction Studio UI for display on the website to qualified visitors, and leverage Campaign Templates to load data, run machine learning, perform A/B testing, and run client-side display logic. Key Web SDK Features \u00b6 Identity and cookie management for anonymous and named identity tracking Web SDK JavaScript beacon for website integration Sitemap for data collection and consent management Gears extensions to augment Interaction Studio platform capabilities Gears extensions for renderng web campaigns The remaining sections of this article introduce each of the above features of the Interaction Studio Web SDK. Identity and Cookie Management \u00b6 The Web SDK supports anonymous and named identity tracking using Interaction Studio first-party cookies or by being passed identity information by the website. This system supports the client portion of the Interaction Studio identity system by optionally updating client identity with an encrypted & nonced primary identity to support the merging of profile identities across different devices and channels. For complete information on how to specify user identities in Interaction Studio, see User Identity Mapping . Interaction Studio First-Party Cookies \u00b6 Interaction Studio cookies are prefixed with _evga_ , and end with a string of characters unique to the dataset to which the cookie belongs. These cookies can be cleared for consent management purposes when a user does not consent to cookie tracking. Web SDK JavaScript Beacon \u00b6 The JavaScript beacon provided with the Interaction Studio Web SDK is required for managing the flow of data between the Interaction Studio platform and the Web SDK libraries used in the client integration. The beacon is a light weight JavaScript file that provides script-loading functionality on page load, as well as an event message bus and the ability to bootstrap plug-ins for advanced logic and integration. Site pages that do not contain the JavaScript beacon will have no behavioral tracking or personalization capabilities. See Validate JavaScript Beacon Deployment for instructions on how to confirm whether the JavaScript beacon is present on a site page. Sitemap \u00b6 The Interaction Studio Sitemap system is a configuration-driven integration layer that is deployed by and executes within the Interaction Studio Web SDK. A \"Sitemap\" is developed to integrate with a specific site using the APIs provided by the Web SDK. These APIs map key business objects of the company into the Interaction Studio system through event capture. This can include page type information and catalog items, supporting the ability to understand user interests against the catalog. Objects can also include items such as products, article content, and categories, and can also include custom dimensions (categorical information about items with custom attributes). See the articles in this site on Sitemap and Data Model for more details. Consent Management Through the Sitemap \u00b6 Some users refuse cookie tracking. The Web SDK will only initialize tracking when it is explicitly initialized within the Sitemap. A simple conditional statement can be added to your Sitemap code in order to prevent Interaction Studio from initializing in the event a user does not consent to cookie tracking. if (consent) Evergage.init().then({ // sitemap code here }); Web SDK Gears Extensions \u00b6 The JavaScript beacon provided with the Interaction Studio Web SDK supports the delivery of custom functionality to augment the client-side functionality of the Interaction Studio Platform through Gears extensions. These extensions are JavaScript files delivered and installed through various Gears which are developed by the Interaction Studio development team. Web Campaign Templates \u00b6 Gears extensions can also be used in configured web templates to deliver campaign and personalization content directly to site code so it may be rendered by the website.

The sample code in this document is not exhaustive and maps only key areas of the site that are valuable for demonstration purposes. The primary focus is depicting how to approach designing a Catalog for B2B websites. While each implementation will be unique, this sitemap contends with many issues, particularly mapping B2B sites and websites without purchasable products in general. **Important:** The example sitemap is for reference purposes only. You should avoid copying this code into your Sitemap Editor as it will not produce the results you intended. Client Requirements \u00b6 This section outlines the functionality that our imaginary client requires from their implementation. Since each client or customer will always have a unique set of requirements and use cases in mind for Interaction Studio, experience will be the real teacher when it comes to knowing what questions to ask clients to help them establish their goals and requirements for their use of Interaction Studio. Primary Goal: \u00b6 Understand the content a user is most interested in based on their prior interactions with the site. Home page type: \u00b6 Recommend Blogs similar to recently viewed Blogs, fallback to promote trending Blogs. Solutions, Learning, and Product Landing page types: \u00b6 Recommend Articles of the same Category (solutions, learn or products) as the currently viewed landing page. Personalize banner based on past interest in Articles under the currently viewed Category Solutions, Learning, and Product page types: \u00b6 Capture Industry , JobRole , PageBundle , and Department values as dimensions. Product page type: \u00b6 Capture Keyword values as a dimension. Recommend related product Articles by Keyword . Distinguish between Add-On and Software products in the Catalog. Blog Landing page type: \u00b6 Recommend trending Blogs . Blog page type: \u00b6 Recommend related Blog posts based on category. Discovery \u00b6 Since it is the only identity consistently available on the web and used as a username when users log in to the site, emailAddress will be the default Web SDK identity attribute used for this implementation. The site already uses email addresses to identify its users, so we will be configuring Interaction Studio to piggyback on that. > Aside : Since an email address is Personally Identifiable Information (PII), make sure you have the appropriate approval from within your organization before using it as an Interaction Studio Identity. Additionally, using emails captured from web forms, other than a login form, as an Identity could potentially cause privacy issues where more than one user is tied to an Interaction Studio user. In the following code, email is only being captured from the login form when a user successfully logs in. The code capturing user id is designed to work on [Tableau Public(https://public.tableau.com/)] as this portion of the Tableau site accesible by everyone with a free public account. For more information on Identity, read Configure the Identity System for the Web SDK . While this site does promote products, there is no ability to purchase products or attribute revenue to them from other channels, matching with user activity from the web. Since we will not need the special capabilities of the Product item type for this implementation, we will instead use the Article item type, utilizing Category to tell types of Article items apart. > Aside : If the website had a more robust, hierarchal category system in which it might be possible to share Category information between the Article types, we would instead configure a dimension specifically to house the type of Article , such as ArticleType . This way, if solutions and products shared Category data, they would be relatable to each other, instead of belonging to siloed Category hierarchies, each starting with their respective Article type (solutions, products, and learning). There is a categorization system already natively built into the site's blog section, so our code will scrape the categories already present in the dataLayer as Category in the Interaction Studio Catalog. Collecting Category data for the Blogs will help build user affinity based on those Categories . These Categories will also power the customer's use case to recommend related Blogs on blog pages based on the currently viewed Category . In addition to Category data, the dataLayer contains other useful information, such as Department and Job Role . The values for Department and Job Role are collected as Dimensions to tie them to each of the collected Article types. As these values are collected, they will be used to build a user's affinity towards them, which can then be used for segmentation and potentially for recommending Articles of any Category based on one of these Dimensions , instead of only recommending Articles of one type at a time. To distinguish between Add-On and Software products in the Catalog, as stated in the \"Client Requirements\", we will be mapping a dimension called ProductType on the \"product\" page type. Remember, we are using the Article item type to house Catalog data for the product , solutions , and learning page types.

The site already uses email addresses to identify its users, so we will be configuring Interaction Studio to piggyback on that. > Aside : Since an email address is Personally Identifiable Information (PII), make sure you have the appropriate approval from within your organization before using it as an Interaction Studio Identity. Additionally, using emails captured from web forms, other than a login form, as an Identity could potentially cause privacy issues where more than one user is tied to an Interaction Studio user. In the following code, email is only being captured from the login form when a user successfully logs in. The code capturing user id is designed to work on [Tableau Public(https://public.tableau.com/)] as this portion of the Tableau site accesible by everyone with a free public account. For more information on Identity, read Configure the Identity System for the Web SDK . While this site does promote products, there is no ability to purchase products or attribute revenue to them from other channels, matching with user activity from the web. Since we will not need the special capabilities of the Product item type for this implementation, we will instead use the Article item type, utilizing Category to tell types of Article items apart. > Aside : If the website had a more robust, hierarchal category system in which it might be possible to share Category information between the Article types, we would instead configure a dimension specifically to house the type of Article , such as ArticleType . This way, if solutions and products shared Category data, they would be relatable to each other, instead of belonging to siloed Category hierarchies, each starting with their respective Article type (solutions, products, and learning). There is a categorization system already natively built into the site's blog section, so our code will scrape the categories already present in the dataLayer as Category in the Interaction Studio Catalog. Collecting Category data for the Blogs will help build user affinity based on those Categories . These Categories will also power the customer's use case to recommend related Blogs on blog pages based on the currently viewed Category . In addition to Category data, the dataLayer contains other useful information, such as Department and Job Role . The values for Department and Job Role are collected as Dimensions to tie them to each of the collected Article types. As these values are collected, they will be used to build a user's affinity towards them, which can then be used for segmentation and potentially for recommending Articles of any Category based on one of these Dimensions , instead of only recommending Articles of one type at a time.
